"""Reusable helpers that demonstrate SQL and MongoDB connection patterns.

The functions in this module deliberately receive their database clients as
arguments so they can be easily tested without establishing real network
connections.  The calling code is responsible for creating the client (or a

    Parameters
    ----------
    client_factory:
        Callable that accepts a credentials mapping and returns a DB-API style
        connection object.  In production this could be ``mysql.connector.connect``
        or ``psycopg2.connect``; in tests this can be a stub or mock.
    query:
        SQL string to execute.
    credentials:
        Mapping that contains the connection details (host, database, user,
        password, etc.).
    parameters:
        Optional sequence of parameters to pass to ``cursor.execute``.
    commit:
        Whether to call ``commit`` on the connection after execution.  This is
        useful for ``INSERT``/``UPDATE`` statements.

    Returns
    -------
    Sequence[Any]
        The rows returned by ``cursor.fetchall()``.  For statements that do not
        return rows this will typically be an empty sequence.
