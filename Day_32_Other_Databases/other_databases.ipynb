    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 32: Connecting to Other Databases (MySQL & MongoDB)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we used `sqlite3`, which is fantastic for learning and small projects because it's built into Python and doesn't require a separate server. However, in a corporate environment, you will most likely be connecting to a more powerful, server-based database like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or a NoSQL database like **MongoDB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great news is that the patterns and skills you just learned are directly transferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to Other SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to other SQL databases, the only thing that changes is the library you use to make the connection. The SQL queries you write and the way you use Pandas to interact with the database remain almost identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would first need to install the appropriate library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For MySQL: `pip install mysql-connector-python`\n",
    "- For PostgreSQL: `pip install psycopg2-binary`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, your connection code would look slightly different, requiring credentials like a username, password, and host address.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import psycopg2\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# The connection details change, but the pattern is the same\n",
    "conn = psycopg2.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"your_database_host\",\n",
    "    database=\"your_database_name\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# After this, using Pandas is EXACTLY the same!\n",
    "sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM sales WHERE region = 'North';\"\n",
    "north_sales_df = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, conn)\n",
    "\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(north_sales_df.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** As an analyst, your main tool, `pandas.read_sql_query`, works the same way. You just need to get the correct connection details from your IT or data engineering team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Brief Introduction to NoSQL: MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all databases are \"relational\" (i.e., table-based) like SQL databases. Another popular category is **NoSQL**, and one of the most popular NoSQL databases is **MongoDB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of tables and rows, MongoDB stores data in **collections** of **documents**. A document is very similar to a Python dictionary or a JSON object, allowing for flexible and nested data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with MongoDB in Python, you use the `pymongo` library:\n",
    "`pip install pymongo`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with `pymongo` for MongoDB:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to the MongoDB server\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://your_username:your_password@your_host')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select your database and collection (similar to a table)\n",
    "db = client['company_db']\n",
    "collection = db['employees']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find a document (similar to a row)\n",
    "# This finds one employee in the 'Sales' department\n",
    "sales_employee = collection.find_one({'department': 'Sales'})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sales_employee)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find multiple documents\n",
    "engineering_employees = collection.find({'department': 'Engineering'})\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can convert the results to a list of dictionaries...\n",
    "engineering_list = list(engineering_employees)\n",
    "# ...and then load that list directly into a Pandas DataFrame!\n",
    "engineering_df = pd.DataFrame(engineering_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "client.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a conceptual lesson to show you that while the specific connection details may change, the skills you've learned are broadly applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any **SQL database**, you will use a specific library to connect, but your interaction will primarily be writing SQL queries and using `pandas.read_sql_query`.\n",
    "- For **NoSQL databases** like MongoDB, you'll use a different library (`pymongo`) and query language, but the goal is the same: get the data into a format that can be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no coding exercises for this day. The goal is to understand the concepts so you are prepared when you encounter these different database systems in the workplace."
