# Day 60 â€“ Graph and Geometric Learning

Graph neural networks capture relational structure beyond Euclidean grids. This lesson focuses on:

- Building GraphSAGE neighbourhood aggregators and graph attention networks (GAT) from first principles.
- Preparing toy graphs and feature matrices compatible with PyTorch Geometric or DGL workflows.
- Training node classifiers with message passing, skip connections, and softmax heads on miniature datasets.
- Evaluating accuracy, attention weights, and representation quality for stakeholder-ready reporting.

Run `python Day_60_Graph_and_Geometric_Learning/solutions.py` to inspect handcrafted GraphSAGE/GAT layers, monitor training metrics on a toy citation-style graph, and export feature embeddings.
