# Day 57 – Recommender Systems

Recommender systems pair users with relevant products when catalogues explode. This lesson covers how to:

- Build user–item matrices and run neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering with cosine similarity.
- Perform low-rank matrix factorisation to uncover latent tastes and fill sparse feedback grids.
- Adapt ranking pipelines for implicit-feedback data by combining confidence weights and popularity priors.
- Evaluate recommenders with hit rate, precision@K, and mean average precision to keep stakeholders aligned on outcomes.

Execute `python Day_57_Recommender_Systems/solutions.py` to generate rankings, matrix factorisation reconstructions,
and evaluation metrics on compact demo datasets.
