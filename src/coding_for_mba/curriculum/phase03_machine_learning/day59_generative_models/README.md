# Day 59 – Generative Models

Generative models synthesise data, compress signals, and enable controllable creativity. In this lesson you will:

- Contrast autoencoders, variational autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models across objectives and sampling procedures.
- Optimise lightweight autoencoders and VAEs on synthetic data to observe reconstruction loss curves.
- Understand GAN training dynamics with simplified generator–discriminator updates and stability heuristics.
- Explore diffusion process fundamentals: forward noising, denoising score matching, and scheduler design.

Execute `python Day_59_Generative_Models/solutions.py` to run miniature training loops that log decreasing reconstruction losses and summarise practical tuning tips.
