    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 14: Modules - Organizing Your Business Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "As your projects grow, you need a way to organize your code. In Python, we do this with **modules**. A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) containing functions and variables. By grouping related functions into modules, you create a clean, maintainable, and scalable project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Organization:** Keeps related code together (e.g., all financial calculations in `financials.py`).\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Import your custom modules into any project.\n",
    "- **Readability:** Makes your main script shorter and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Import Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Import the entire module (recommended):**\n",
    "This is the most common way. You access functions using the `module_name.function_name` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import business_logic as bl\n",
    "roi = bl.calculate_roi(50000, 10000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Import a specific function:**\n",
    "If you only need one or two functions from a large module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from business_logic import calculate_roi\n",
    "roi = calculate_roi(50000, 10000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python's Built-in Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a huge **Standard Library** of built-in modules, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `math`: For advanced mathematical functions (`math.sqrt()`).\n",
    "- `datetime`: Essential for working with dates and times.\n",
    "- `random`: For generating random numbers (useful for sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this lesson is split into two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `business_logic.py`: A module containing reusable functions.\n",
    "- `modules.py`: The main script that imports and uses the `business_logic` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have refactored `modules.py` to wrap its logic in functions and deleted a redundant, unused module file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open both `Day_14_Modules/business_logic.py` and `Day_14_Modules/modules.py`. See how the main script imports and uses the functions defined in the module.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the main script:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_14_Modules/modules.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of the functions in the `business_logic` module:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_14.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 14\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Your Own Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a new file named `text_tools.py`.\n",
    "   - Inside this file, define a function `count_characters(text)` that returns the length of a string.\n",
    "   - Create a second file, `main_report.py`.\n",
    "   - In `main_report.py`, import your `text_tools` module and use your function to count the characters in a sample sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use the `datetime` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script, `import` the `datetime` module.\n",
    "   - Get the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.\n",
    "   - Print the current date.\n",
    "   - Print just the current year from the date object (e.g., `my_date.year`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use the `math` Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A company's sales are growing by the square root of its marketing budget.\n",
    "   - `import` the `math` module.\n",
    "   - Create a variable `marketing_budget = 100000`.\n",
    "   - Use `math.sqrt()` to calculate the growth factor and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Well done!** You've learned how to organize your code into modules. This is a critical skill for building any project that's more than a few dozen lines long."
