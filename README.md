# Python for Business Analytics - A 30-Day Course

Welcome to **Python for Business Analytics**, a 30-day, self-paced course designed specifically for aspiring business leaders, MBA students, and anyone interested in leveraging the power of Python for data-driven decision-making.

This curriculum was built from the ground up to be practical and business-focused, assuming **zero prior programming experience**. Each day's lesson includes a conceptual `README.md` file, a Python script with code examples (`*.py`), and a `solutions.py` file for the exercises.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into three main parts, taking you from the absolute basics of Python to building your own data products.

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals for Business (Days 1-14)
This section covers the core building blocks of the Python language, with all examples and exercises framed in a business context. You'll learn to work with variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, and loops by using them to analyze sales data, manage customer records, and calculate financial metrics.

### Part 2: Core Data Analytics & Visualization (Days 15-25)
Here, we dive into the essential libraries that power data analysis in Python.
- **NumPy:** The foundation for numerical computing.
- **Pandas:** The ultimate tool for data manipulation and analysisâ€”think Excel on steroids.
- **Data Cleaning:** Learn the most critical skill for any analyst: how to handle messy, real-world data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Create beautiful, publication-quality static charts.
- **Plotly:** Build interactive, web-based visualizations for modern dashboards.
- **Web Scraping:** Learn to extract data directly from websites.
- **Statistics:** Understand the fundamentals of descriptive and inferential statistics to draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Capstone Case Study:** Apply all your new skills to solve a realistic business problem from start to finish.

### Part 3: Advanced Topics & Deployment (Days 26-30)
This final section prepares you to work like a professional, managing projects and delivering your analysis to others.
- **Virtual Environments:** Learn the best practice for managing project dependencies.
- **Databases:** Connect to and pull data from databases using Python.
- **APIs:** Learn to interact with external services to get live data, and learn to build your own simple API with Flask to serve your analysis to others.
- **Conclusion:** Recap your journey and explore pathways to further learning in machine learning and big data.
