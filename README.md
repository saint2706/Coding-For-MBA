# 37 Days of Python - A Structured Learning Path

Welcome to the 37 Days of Python challenge, a structured and comprehensive curriculum designed to take you from the fundamentals of Python to advanced topics in data science, web development, and more. This repository has been reorganized to provide a logical and progressive learning experience.

## How to Use This Repository

Each day's folder contains a lesson, example code, and exercises to solidify your understanding. It is recommended to follow the days in order, as they build upon concepts from previous lessons.

1.  **Start with Day 1:** Each day's folder is named `Day_XX_TopicName`. Begin with `Day_01_Introduction`.
2.  **Read the README:** Most day folders have their own `README.md` with specific instructions for that day's lesson.
3.  **Explore the Code:** The `.py` files contain the lesson's code. Read through it to understand the concepts in practice.
4.  **Do the Exercises:** The `solutions.py` file (in many of the earlier lessons) contains exercises for you to solve. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions.
