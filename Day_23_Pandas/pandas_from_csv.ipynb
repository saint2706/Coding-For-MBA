    "# 📘 Day 23: Pandas - Your Data Analysis Superpower\n",
    "\n",
    "If NumPy is the foundation, **Pandas** is the tool you will use every single day for practical data analysis. It is the most important library for data manipulation in Python, giving it the capabilities of a super-powered spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Data Structures: Series and DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Series`**: A one-dimensional labeled array, like a single column in a spreadsheet.\n",
    "- **`DataFrame`**: A two-dimensional labeled table with columns of potentially different types. This is the primary object you will work with in Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key DataFrame Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creation:** Create a DataFrame from a dictionary (`pd.DataFrame(my_dict)`) or by reading a file (`pd.read_csv('my_file.csv')`).\n",
    "- **Inspection:** Always inspect your data after loading.\n",
    "  - `df.head()`: Shows the first 5 rows.\n",
    "  - `df.info()`: Provides a summary of columns, data types, and non-null values.\n",
    "  - `df.describe()`: Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns.\n",
    "- **Selection:** Select a single column (`df['ColumnName']`) or multiple columns (`df[['Col1', 'Col2']]`).\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations:** Create new columns by performing operations on existing ones (e.g., `df['Revenue'] = df['Price'] * df['Units Sold']`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries (including `pandas`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The content for this lesson is split into two main files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`pandas_introduction.ipynb`**: A new Jupyter Notebook that interactively walks through creating a DataFrame from scratch, inspecting it, and creating a visualization. This is the recommended starting point for this lesson.\n",
    "1. **`pandas_from_csv.py`**: A refactored Python script that demonstrates the more common workflow of loading data from a CSV file and filtering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- To explore the notebook, you'll need to have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter`) and run `jupyter notebook` from your terminal.\n",
    "- To run the script from the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`):\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  python Day_23_Pandas/pandas_from_csv.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- To run the tests for the script:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pytest tests/test_day_23.py\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 Exercises: Day 23\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create an Employee DataFrame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_23.py`), create a Python dictionary to store data for 3-4 employees (e.g., `Name`, `Department`, `Salary`).\n",
    "   - Convert this dictionary into a Pandas DataFrame and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze Sales Data from a File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import the `load_data_from_csv` and `filter_by_title` functions from the `pandas_from_csv` script.\n",
    "   - The path to the data file is `data/hacker_news.csv`. Load it using the function.\n",
    "   - Use the `filter_by_title` function to find all articles with \"Google\" in the title and print their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate a New Column:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a DataFrame with `'Price'` and `'Units Sold'` columns.\n",
    "   - Create a new column called `'Revenue'` by multiplying the 'Price' and 'Units Sold' columns.\n",
    "   - Display the DataFrame with the new `'Revenue'` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 **Welcome to Pandas!** You've just learned how to create and inspect the most fundamental object in data analysis. In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into selecting, filtering, and cleaning data."
