    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 13: Higher-Order Functions & Lambda\n",
    "\n",
    "A **higher-order function** is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. This is a powerful concept used heavily in data analysis for its conciseness and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`map(function, iterable)`:** Applies a function to every item in an iterable (e.g., a list).\n",
    "- **`filter(function, iterable)`:** Creates a new iterable containing only the items for which the function returns `True`.\n",
    "- **`sorted(iterable, key=function)`:** Sorts an iterable. The `key` argument takes a function that specifies what to sort by.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lambda Functions: Quick, Anonymous Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **lambda function** is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. They are perfect for use with higher-order functions when you need a simple, one-off function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`lambda arguments: expression`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The 'for' loop way\n",
    "new_salaries = []\n",
    "for s in salaries:\n",
    "    new_salaries.append(s * 1.10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The map and lambda way\n",
    "new_salaries = list(map(lambda s: s * 1.10, salaries))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `HOF.py`, has been refactored to place each higher-order function task into its own testable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_13_Higher_Order_Functions/HOF.py`. Notice the functions `apply_bonus_to_salaries()`, `filter_high_yield_projects()`, and `sort_products_by_attribute()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_13_Higher_Order_Functions/HOF.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_13.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 13\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardize Department Names:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_13.py`), create a list of department names: `departments = [\"Sales\", \" marketing \", \"  Engineering\", \"HR  \"]`.\n",
    "   - Write a function that takes this list and uses `map` with a `lambda` function to return a new list where each name is cleaned (whitespace stripped) and converted to lowercase.\n",
    "   - Call your function and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter Active Subscriptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of customer dictionaries (see below).\n",
    "   - Import the `get_active_customer_names` function from the lesson script.\n",
    "   - Call the function with the customer list and print the names of the active customers.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     customers = [\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Cust A\", \"subscription_status\": \"active\"},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Cust B\", \"subscription_status\": \"inactive\"},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Cust C\", \"subscription_status\": \"active\"}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort Complex Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of product dictionaries.\n",
    "   - Import the `sort_products_by_attribute` function.\n",
    "   - Call the function twice: once to sort the products by `\"price\"` and once to sort them by `\"name\"`. Print both sorted lists.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     products = [\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Laptop\", \"price\": 1200},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Mouse\", \"price\": 25},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Keyboard\", \"price\": 75}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** Higher-order functions and lambdas are a gateway to a more powerful style of programming that you will see everywhere in the world of data science."
