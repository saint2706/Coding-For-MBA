# Day 82 – BI ETL and Pipeline Automation

Day 82 extends the roadmap by transforming the ETL and automation nodes into a
workshop on orchestrated analytics delivery. The lesson groups the roadmap
material into three facilitation threads:

- **Pipeline foundations** – Revisit the pillars of extract, transform, and
  load so that cross-functional stakeholders can align on service-level
  expectations, data contracts, and refresh cadences.
- **Automation toolkit** – Show how dedicated tooling (Airflow, dbt, and vendor
  ETL platforms) codifies business logic, introduces observability, and makes
  deployments repeatable.
- **Delivery lifecycle** – Tie the upstream mechanics to the end-to-end
  analytics project lifecycle, from source audits through dashboard refreshes
  and stakeholder communications.

The accompanying notebook-style script assembles a canonical pipeline outline,
projects it into an Airflow DAG stub, and demonstrates how dbt models and
exposures consume those assets. Use the walkthrough to frame automation
practices such as dependency management, retries, lineage tracking, and BI
handoffs without requiring access to a live orchestrator.
