If you have a new idea, open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/discussions) in the **Feedback & Ideas** category to align on direction before building.

## Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA.git
   cd Coding-For-MBA
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (Python 3.12+ recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # for linting and tests
   ```
4. **Optional extras**: Use `make format`, `make lint`, and `mkdocs serve` to work with formatting and documentation locally.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Discuss** ‚Äì Search existing [issues](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/discussions). Open a new thread or issue if needed to gather context.
2. **Fork & branch** ‚Äì Fork the repository and create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. **Make focused changes** ‚Äì Follow the project structure; update or add tests and documentation that reflect the change.
4. **Run checks locally**
   ```bash
   make format  # optional but recommended
   make lint
   pytest
   ```
5. **Commit with context** ‚Äì Write clear commit messages summarizing the change and reference related issues.
6. **Submit a pull request** ‚Äì Provide:
   - A concise summary of changes
   - Testing evidence (commands run)
   - Screenshots or recordings if you modified visual output
   - Links to related discussions or issues
7. **Collaborate on review** ‚Äì Be ready to answer questions, iterate on feedback, and keep discussions respectful. Once approved, maintainers will merge your pull request.
