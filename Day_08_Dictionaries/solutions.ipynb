    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 8: Dictionaries - Structuring Complex Business Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world business data is structured. A customer has a name, an email, and a location. A product has a price, an SKU, and an inventory count. For this, we need **dictionaries**. A dictionary is the most important data structure for handling structured data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is an **unordered** collection of **key-value pairs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key:** A unique identifier for a piece of data (e.g., `\"first_name\"`).\n",
    "- **Value:** The data itself (e.g., `\"John\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "customer = {\n",
    "    \"customer_id\": \"CUST-001\",\n",
    "    \"first_name\": \"John\",\n",
    "    \"last_name\": \"Doe\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Dictionary Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Data:** Use the key in square brackets (`customer[\"first_name\"]`). For safer access, use the `.get()` method (`customer.get(\"phone\", \"N/A\")`), which returns a default value if the key doesn't exist.\n",
    "- **Adding/Modifying:** Assign a value to a key (`customer[\"phone\"] = \"555-123-4567\"`).\n",
    "- **Removing:** Use the `del` keyword (`del customer[\"company\"]`).\n",
    "- **Nesting:** Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries or lists, allowing you to model complex structures like an employee profile with nested contact info and a list of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `dictionaries.py`, has been refactored to encapsulate dictionary operations into testable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_08_Dictionaries/dictionaries.py`. Notice the functions like `create_customer_profile()`, `update_customer_record()`, and `add_project_to_employee()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_08_Dictionaries/dictionaries.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_08.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 8\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Product Dictionary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_08.py`), create a function `create_product(product_id, name, price, in_stock, tags)`.\n",
    "   - The function should accept these arguments and return a dictionary representing a product.\n",
    "   - Call the function with sample data (e.g., `PROD-123`, `SuperWidget`, `199.99`, `True`, `[\"electronics\", \"gadget\"]`) and print the resulting dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify Employee Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Start with the `employee_record` dictionary from the lesson's main block.\n",
    "   - Import the `add_project_to_employee` function.\n",
    "   - Call the function to add a new project, \"2025 Strategy,\" to the employee's project list.\n",
    "   - Separately, update the `department` key of your new dictionary to \"Marketing Director\".\n",
    "   - Print the final, updated employee dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Nested Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a dictionary for a `company` with keys `company_name` and `headquarters`.\n",
    "   - The value for `headquarters` should be another dictionary with keys for `city`, `state`, and `country`.\n",
    "   - Write a script that creates this dictionary and then prints a sentence like: `\"[Company Name] is headquartered in [City], [State].\"`, accessing the nested values to build the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Amazing work!** Dictionaries are the cornerstone of handling structured data in Python. Almost every time you get data from an API or a database, it will be in the form of dictionaries. Mastering them is a huge step forward."
