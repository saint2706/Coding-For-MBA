# Day 70 – BI Metrics and Data Literacy

Day 70 focuses on translating the BI roadmap's metrics and statistics nodes into a cohesive
classroom conversation. The taxonomy groups the roadmap material into four facilitation
modules:

- **Metric design** – Clarify how analysts connect business objectives to measurement by
  introducing the KPI lifecycle and the major analysis modalities (descriptive and predictive)
  that underpin dashboard storytelling.
- **Data typing** – Review how variable types gate which aggregations and visual encodings are
  valid so teams can choose the right KPI denominator and segmentation logic.
- **Descriptive statistics** – Revisit central tendency tools (mode, mean, median) as the
  building blocks for summary tables, baselines, and trend interpretation.
- **Inferential readiness** – Frame the mindset shifts needed when moving from descriptive work
  into experimentation, including correlation caveats, confidence intervals, and inferential
  testing fundamentals.

The accompanying lesson script demonstrates how to implement these concepts with pandas by
calculating funnel conversion rates, revenue KPIs, and marketing ROI from a sample campaign
DataFrame. Use it to guide the discussion from conceptual taxonomy to practical KPI analysis.
