# Day 78 – BI Experimentation and Predictive Insights

This lesson connects experimentation design, forecasting, and machine learning so BI teams can run trustworthy experiments and produce forward-looking recommendations.

## What's inside

- `lesson.py` – runnable walkthrough covering experimentation diagnostics, cohort retention, linear-trend forecasting, and predictive modelling/segmentation patterns.
- `solutions.py` – reusable helpers grouped into Experimentation, Forecasting, and Machine learning sections for quick import into notebooks or dashboards.

## How to use

1. Run `python -m Day_78_BI_Experimentation_and_Predictive_Insights.lesson` to print reference outputs for experimentation, forecasting, and learning workflows.
2. Import functions from `solutions.py` in your own notebook or BI job to calculate A/B lift, cohort retention tables, or supervised predictions on new datasets.
3. Pair forecasting outputs with experimentation insights to prioritise roadmap decisions and align downstream stakeholders.

## Practitioner checklist

- Frame experiments with clear hypotheses, power targets, and retention cohorts before launch.
- Track time-series drivers separately for level, trend, and seasonality to explain BI forecasts.
- Use lightweight regression and segmentation helpers for fast predictive insights before escalating to heavier models.
- Document p-value interpretations and error trade-offs so cross-functional partners understand the decision logic.
