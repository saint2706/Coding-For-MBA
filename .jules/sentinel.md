# Sentinel Learnings

- Replacing `Math.random` with `crypto.getRandomValues` in contexts where true cryptographically secure numbers aren't needed (e.g. basic UI components and simple array selections) is security theater and can introduce crashes in Node SSR environments if `crypto` isn't imported correctly.
- Added array validation to local storage JSON parsing (`Array.isArray()`) to prevent array prototype pollution from bypassing object checks (CWE-20).
