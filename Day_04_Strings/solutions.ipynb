    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 4: Working with Text Data - Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "In business analytics, text data is everywhereâ€”customer names, product reviews, addresses, and report narratives. In Python, we handle text using **strings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key String Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F-Strings:** The modern and most readable way to format strings. They let you embed variables and expressions directly inside a string.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  report_summary = f\"Company: {company_name}, Revenue: ${revenue}\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **String Methods:** Built-in functions attached to strings that let you manipulate them. They are essential for data cleaning and preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Description | Business Use Case |\n",
    "| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |\n",
    "| `.lower()`/`.upper()` | Converts case. | Standardizing categories. |\n",
    "| `.strip()` | Removes whitespace from the beginning and end. | Cleaning user-entered data. |\n",
    "| `.replace()` | Replaces a substring with another. | Correcting or reformatting data. |\n",
    "| `.split()` | Splits the string into a list of substrings. | Parsing comma-separated data. |\n",
    "| `.startswith()`| Checks if the string starts with a substring. | Identifying invoice numbers. |\n",
    "| `.endswith()` | Checks if the string ends with a substring. | Checking file types. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `strings.py`, has been refactored into functions to make each string manipulation a reusable and testable unit of logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_04_Strings/strings.py`. Each data transformation (e.g., `generate_report_header()`, `clean_and_format_name()`) is now its own function.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_04_Strings/strings.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_04.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 4\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate a Report Header:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_04.py`), create a function `format_report_title(title, date)`.\n",
    "   - The function should take a title string and a date string and return a formatted header like: `--- MONTHLY MARKETING REPORT: 2024-07 ---`.\n",
    "   - Call the function and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clean Up Product Codes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of raw product codes: `[\" prod-001 \", \"prod-002\", \" Prod-003 \"]`.\n",
    "   - Create a function `clean_product_codes(codes)` that takes a list of codes.\n",
    "   - Inside the function, loop through the list, and for each code, remove whitespace and convert it to uppercase.\n",
    "   - The function should return a new list of cleaned codes.\n",
    "   - Call the function and print the cleaned list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate Email Addresses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `is_valid_email(email)` that performs two simple checks:\n",
    "     - Does the email contain an `@` symbol?\n",
    "     - Does the email end with `.com`?\n",
    "   - The function should return `True` if both conditions are met, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "   - Test your function with a valid email (`\"test@example.com\"`) and an invalid one (`\"test-example.com\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Fantastic!** You can now manipulate text data, which is a massive part of any real-world data analysis task. Cleaning, formatting, and parsing strings are skills you'll use every single day."
