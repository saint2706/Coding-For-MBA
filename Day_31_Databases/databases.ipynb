    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 31: Working with Databases in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "While CSV files are great for smaller datasets, most real-world business data is stored in **databases**. Databases are systems designed for storing, managing, and retrieving large amounts of structured data efficiently and safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst, you will almost certainly need to pull data from a database. Learning to do this with Python is a critical skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence:** The data is stored safely on disk and doesn't disappear when you turn off your computer.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Databases are designed to handle enormous amounts of dataâ€”far more than can fit in a spreadsheet.\n",
    "- **Querying:** Databases use a powerful language called **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to let you select, filter, and aggregate the exact data you need.\n",
    "- **Concurrency:** They allow multiple users to access and modify the data at the same time without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is the standard language for relational databases. Here are a few of the most important commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT [column1], [column2]`: Specifies the columns you want.\n",
    "- `FROM [table]`: Specifies the table you're getting data from.\n",
    "- `WHERE [condition]`: Filters the rows based on a condition.\n",
    "- `GROUP BY [column]`: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.\n",
    "- `JOIN`: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python's `sqlite3` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in module called `sqlite3` that allows you to work with a lightweight, serverless database called SQLite. The entire database is just a single file on your computer, making it perfect for learning and for smaller applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect:** Create a connection object to the database file.\n",
    "1. **Cursor:** Create a cursor object, which allows you to execute SQL commands.\n",
    "1. **Execute:** Run your SQL query.\n",
    "1. **Fetch:** Retrieve the results from the cursor.\n",
    "1. **Close:** Close the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Connect to the database (creates the file if it doesn't exist)\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')\n",
    "# 2. Create a cursor\n",
    "cur = conn.cursor()\n",
    "# 3. Execute a query\n",
    "cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';\")\n",
    "# 4. Fetch the results\n",
    "sales_employees = cur.fetchall()\n",
    "# 5. Close the connection\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Pandas Way: `read_sql_query`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sqlite3` workflow is a bit verbose. For data analysis, there's a much easier way. Pandas can interact with databases directly and load the results of a query into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pd.read_sql_query()` function takes an SQL query and a connection object and returns a full DataFrame. This is the method you will use most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')\n",
    "sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';\"\n",
    "\n",
    "sales_df = pd.read_sql_query(sql_query, conn)\n",
    "\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "# sales_df is now a Pandas DataFrame ready for analysis!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 31\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create and Populate a Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Write a script that creates a new SQLite database called `company.db`.\n",
    "   - Create a table named `products` with three columns: `product_id` (INTEGER), `name` (TEXT), and `price` (REAL).\n",
    "   - Insert 3-4 sample products into the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query with `sqlite3`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Write a script that connects to the `company.db` you created.\n",
    "   - Execute a SQL query to select all products with a price greater than $100.\n",
    "   - Fetch all the results and loop through them, printing each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query with Pandas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Write a script that connects to the `company.db`.\n",
    "   - Use `pd.read_sql_query()` to select all records from the `products` table and load them into a DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Print the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** You can now connect to and retrieve data from a database, the primary source of truth for most businesses. Knowing how to pull data directly into a Pandas DataFrame is a workflow you will use constantly as a data analyst."
