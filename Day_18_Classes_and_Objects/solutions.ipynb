    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 18: Classes and Objects - Modeling Business Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've organized our code with functions. But what if you want to model a real-world concept, like a \"Customer,\" that has both data (name, email) and actions (calculate total spending)? For this, we use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and its building blocks: **classes** and **objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Classes and Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Class** is a blueprint for creating an object. It defines the data (attributes) and actions (methods) that the object will have. Think of `Car` as a class.\n",
    "- An **Object** is an instance of a class. It's a concrete thing created from the blueprint. Your specific `toyota_camry` would be an object of the `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is powerful because it lets you bundle data and the functions that operate on that data together in a clean, logical way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Class Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__init__(self, ...)`:** The \"initializer\" or \"constructor\" method. It runs automatically when you create a new object and is used to set up its initial attributes.\n",
    "- **`self`:** Represents the instance of the class itself. Inside a method, you use `self` to access the object's own attributes (e.g., `self.firstname`).\n",
    "- **Attributes:** Variables that belong to an object (e.g., `person.firstname`).\n",
    "- **Methods:** Functions that belong to an object (e.g., `person.account_balance()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `CaO.py`, has been refactored for clarity and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_18_Classes_and_Objects/CaO.py`.\n",
    "   - The `Statistics` class now gracefully handles empty data and potential errors when calculating the mode.\n",
    "   - The `PersonAccount` class has been streamlined to add incomes and expenses via methods, which is a more standard object-oriented approach.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the classes instantiated and their methods called:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_18_Classes_and_Objects/CaO.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each class and its methods under various conditions:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_18.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 18\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a `Product` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_18.py`), create a class named `Product`.\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method should take `name`, `price`, and `initial_quantity` as arguments and store them as attributes.\n",
    "   - Add a method `get_inventory_value()` that returns the total value of the product's inventory (`price * quantity`).\n",
    "   - Add a method `restock(amount)` that increases the product's quantity.\n",
    "   - Create an instance of your `Product` class, check its initial inventory value, restock it, and then check the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extend the `PersonAccount` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import the `PersonAccount` class from the lesson script.\n",
    "   - Create an instance of the class for a new person.\n",
    "   - Add several income and expense items using the `.add_income()` and `.add_expense()` methods.\n",
    "   - Print the final account summary using the `.account_info()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've learned the basics of object-oriented programming. This will enable you to write more organized, powerful, and scalable analytical scripts that model real-world business concepts."
