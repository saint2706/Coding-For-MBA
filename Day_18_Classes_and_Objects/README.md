# ðŸ“˜ Day 18: Classes and Objects - Modeling Business Concepts

So far, we've organized our code with functions. But what if you want to model a real-world concept, like a "Customer," that has both data (name, email) and actions (calculate total spending)? For this, we use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and its building blocks: **classes** and **objects**.

## What are Classes and Objects?

*   A **Class** is a blueprint for creating an object. It defines the data (attributes) and actions (methods) that the object will have. Think of `Car` as a class.
*   An **Object** is an instance of a class. It's a concrete thing created from the blueprint. Your specific `toyota_camry` would be an object of the `Car` class.

This approach is powerful because it lets you bundle data and the functions that operate on that data together in a clean, logical way.

## Key Class Concepts

*   **`__init__(self, ...)`:** The "initializer" or "constructor" method. It runs automatically when you create a new object and is used to set up its initial attributes.
*   **`self`:** Represents the instance of the class itself. Inside a method, you use `self` to access the object's own attributes (e.g., `self.firstname`).
*   **Attributes:** Variables that belong to an object (e.g., `person.firstname`).
*   **Methods:** Functions that belong to an object (e.g., `person.account_balance()`).

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `CaO.py`, has been refactored for clarity and robustness.

1.  **Review the Code:** Open `Day_18_Classes_and_Objects/CaO.py`.
    *   The `Statistics` class now gracefully handles empty data and potential errors when calculating the mode.
    *   The `PersonAccount` class has been streamlined to add incomes and expenses via methods, which is a more standard object-oriented approach.
2.  **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the classes instantiated and their methods called:
    ```bash
    python Day_18_Classes_and_Objects/CaO.py
    ```
3.  **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each class and its methods under various conditions:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_day_18.py
    ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 18

1.  **Create a `Product` Class:**
    *   In a new script (`my_solutions_18.py`), create a class named `Product`.
    *   The `__init__` method should take `name`, `price`, and `initial_quantity` as arguments and store them as attributes.
    *   Add a method `get_inventory_value()` that returns the total value of the product's inventory (`price * quantity`).
    *   Add a method `restock(amount)` that increases the product's quantity.
    *   Create an instance of your `Product` class, check its initial inventory value, restock it, and then check the new value.

2.  **Extend the `PersonAccount` Class:**
    *   Import the `PersonAccount` class from the lesson script.
    *   Create an instance of the class for a new person.
    *   Add several income and expense items using the `.add_income()` and `.add_expense()` methods.
    *   Print the final account summary using the `.account_info()` method.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've learned the basics of object-oriented programming. This will enable you to write more organized, powerful, and scalable analytical scripts that model real-world business concepts.
