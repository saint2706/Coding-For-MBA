# Day 64 â€“ Modern NLP Pipelines

Connect discrete NLP components into a reproducible workflow. After this lesson you will:

- Tokenize text with configurable normalization options.
- Build deterministic embedding tables for rapid experimentation.
- Fine-tune a lightweight transformer-style classifier head on sentence labels.
- Retrieve support passages and perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Evaluate generations with deterministic exact-match and token-overlap metrics.

Run `python Day_64_Modern_NLP_Pipelines/solutions.py` to explore end-to-end text processing with seeded toy corpora.
