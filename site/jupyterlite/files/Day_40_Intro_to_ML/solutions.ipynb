    "# Day 40: Introduction to Machine Learning & Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces the machine learning workflow and highlights how evaluation techniques ensure reliable models. You'll generate data, configure cross-validation, train a linear model, and compute mean squared error metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Prerequisites:** Install scikit-learn with `pip install scikit-learn` before running the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Paradigms:** Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning cover most ML problems and inform how we collect data and labels.\n",
    "- **Biasâ€“Variance Trade-off:** Balances model simplicity and flexibility; too much bias underfits, too much variance overfits.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation:** Splits data into multiple folds so every observation is used for both training and validation, yielding a robust performance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Generation:** `generate_dataset()` creates a noisy linear regression dataset for experimentation.\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation Setup:** `setup_kfold()` configures the resampling strategy, while `train_linear_regression()` and `evaluate_model()` encapsulate model training and scoring.\n",
    "1. **Model Assessment:** `cross_validate_model()` runs the full loop and reports per-fold and average mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the worked examples: `python Day_40_Intro_to_ML/solutions.py`\n",
    "- Execute the automated checks: `pytest tests/test_day_40.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore the full [Machine Learning Curriculum Roadmap](../docs/ml_curriculum.md) to see how the Day 40 lesson fits into a multi-phase path covering deep learning, responsible AI, and MLOps."
