    "# Day 39: Math Foundations - Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculus powers the optimisation routines that train machine learning models. Derivatives, gradients, and the chain rule reveal how model parameters should change to reduce loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Derivatives:** Measure how a function changes with respect to its input; the slope guides the direction of parameter updates.\n",
    "- **Gradients:** Vectors of partial derivatives for multivariate functions that point toward steepest ascent. Optimisation algorithms step in the opposite direction.\n",
    "- **Chain Rule:** Provides the derivative of nested functions and forms the backbone of backpropagation in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symbolic Differentiation:** `symbolic_derivative()` returns a polynomial and its derivative using SymPy.\n",
    "1. **Numerical Gradient:** `numerical_gradient()` estimates the gradient of `x^2*y + y^3` at `(2, 3)` via finite differences.\n",
    "1. **Chain Rule Application:** `chain_rule_derivative()` expands `(2x + 1)^2` and differentiates it with respect to `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the worked examples: `python Day_39_Calculus/solutions.py`\n",
    "- Execute the automated checks: `pytest tests/test_day_39.py`"
