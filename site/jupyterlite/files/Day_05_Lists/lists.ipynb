    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 5: Managing Collections of Business Data with Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In business, you often work with collections of data: lists of customers, quarterly sales figures, products, and more. Python's most fundamental tool for managing ordered collections is the **list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a List?\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is an ordered, changeable collection of items, created by placing items inside square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A list of department names (strings)\n",
    "departments = [\"Sales\", \"Marketing\", \"Human Resources\", \"Engineering\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# A list of quarterly sales figures (floats)\n",
    "quarterly_sales = [120000.50, 135000.75, 110000.00, 145000.25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Data:** Use an item's **index** (position starting from 0) to access it. `departments[0]` returns `\"Sales\"`. Negative indexing like `departments[-1]` gets the last item.\n",
    "- **Slicing:** Get a sub-section of a list, like `quarterly_sales[0:2]` for the first two quarters.\n",
    "- **Modifying Data:** Lists are dynamic. Key methods include:\n",
    "  - `.append()`: Adds an item to the end.\n",
    "  - `.remove()`: Removes the first item with a specified value.\n",
    "  - `.sort()`: Sorts the list in place, which is great for ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `lists.py`, has been refactored into functions to make the logic for each list operation reusable and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_05_Lists/lists.py`. Each list operation (e.g., `add_product()`, `analyze_team_sales()`) is now its own function. Notice that the functions return a *new* list rather than modifying the original, which is a good practice to avoid unexpected side effects.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_05_Lists/lists.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_05.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 5\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manage a Product List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_05.py`), create a list of product names: `[\"Laptop\", \"Mouse\", \"Keyboard\", \"Monitor\"]`.\n",
    "   - A new product, \"Webcam\", is now in stock. Call the `add_product` function (you can import it) to get a new list with the webcam.\n",
    "   - The \"Mouse\" is sold out. Call the `remove_product` function on your *new* list.\n",
    "   - Print the final list of available products.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze Monthly Expenses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `analyze_expenses(expenses)` that takes a list of numbers.\n",
    "   - The function should return a dictionary containing the `total_expenses`, `highest_expense`, and `lowest_expense`.\n",
    "   - Call the function with a list like `[2200, 2350, 2600, 2130, 2190]` and print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Top Sales Performers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `analyze_team_sales` function in `lists.py` already does this.\n",
    "   - Import it into your script: `from Day_05_Lists.lists import analyze_team_sales`.\n",
    "   - Call the function with a list of sales figures: `[5000, 8000, 4500, 12000, 6000, 11000]`.\n",
    "   - Print the `top_3_sales` from the dictionary that the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Great job!** Lists are the workhorse for storing collections of data in Python. Understanding how to manage and analyze data within lists is a fundamental skill for any data analyst."
