    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 9: Conditionals - Implementing Business Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is full of rules and decisions. \"If a customer spends over $100, they get a 10% discount.\" \"If inventory is below 50 units, flag it for reorder.\" In Python, we implement this decision-making process using **conditional statements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`if`:** Executes a block of code **only if** a certain condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **`else`:** Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the `if` condition is `False`.\n",
    "- **`elif` (\"else if\"):** Lets you check for multiple, sequential conditions. Python executes the *first* block where the condition is `True` and then skips the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Classifying a customer based on their total spending\n",
    "if total_spent > 1000:\n",
    "    customer_tier = \"Gold\"\n",
    "elif total_spent > 500:\n",
    "    customer_tier = \"Silver\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    customer_tier = \"Standard\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `conditionals.py`, has been refactored to encapsulate each business rule into a separate, testable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_09_Conditionals/conditionals.py`. Notice the functions `calculate_discount_percent()`, `calculate_shipping_cost()`, and `calculate_employee_bonus()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_09_Conditionals/conditionals.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function under various conditions:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_09.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 9\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discount Policy Automation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_09.py`), import the `calculate_discount_percent` function.\n",
    "   - Define a `purchase_amount` variable.\n",
    "   - Call the function to get the discount rate, then calculate the final price (`purchase_amount * (1 - discount_rate)`).\n",
    "   - Print the original amount, the discount rate, and the final price. Test it with amounts like `120`, `75`, and `40`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shipping Cost Calculator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import the `calculate_shipping_cost` function.\n",
    "   - Call the function with different combinations of countries (`\"USA\"`, `\"Canada\"`, `\"Mexico\"`) and weights (`40`, `60`) to see the results. Print a user-friendly message for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Employee Bonus Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import the `calculate_employee_bonus` function.\n",
    "   - Test the function by calling it with different scenarios and printing the result:\n",
    "     - A \"Sales\" employee with a `performance_rating` of 5.\n",
    "     - An \"Engineering\" employee with a `performance_rating` of 4.\n",
    "     - Any employee with a rating of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Fantastic progress!** You can now translate complex business rules into code that makes decisions automatically. This is a fundamental skill for automating reports and building analytical models."
