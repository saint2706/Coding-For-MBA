## Welcome to the Course

Welcome, future business leader! You're about to take your first step into a larger world of data-driven decision-making. In today's business landscape, the ability to understand and leverage data is not just a technical skill‚Äîit's a core competency for effective management. This course is designed specifically for MBA students like you. We'll skip the abstract computer science jargon and focus on one thing: **using Python as a powerful tool to solve real-world business problems.**

You don't need any prior coding experience. We'll start from zero and build your skills step-by-step. By the end of this 50-day journey, you'll be able to manipulate data, generate insights, and even build predictive models.

## Why Python for Business?

1. **The Lingua Franca of Data:** Python is the most widely used language for data science, machine learning, and analytics.
1. **Automation of Tedious Tasks:** Automate cleaning messy Excel sheets, gathering web data, or generating weekly reports.
1. **Powerful Analytics at Your Fingertips:** Python's extensive libraries allow for complex statistical analysis and compelling data visualizations.
1. **Strategic Advantage:** Understanding the language of your data science team gives you a significant strategic advantage.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, please follow the setup instructions in the main [README.md](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/blob/main/README.md) at the root of this repository. This will guide you through:

1. Cloning the project.
1. Setting up a virtual environment.
1. Installing all the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`.

Once you have completed those steps and activated your virtual environment, you are ready to start this lesson.

## Your First Python Script: A Business Calculation

Let's explore the code for today's lesson. The script for this lesson is `helloworld.py`.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_01_Introduction/helloworld.py` in your code editor. You will see that the code is now organized into functions, which is a best practice for writing clean and reusable code.
1. **Run the Script:** To run the script, make sure your terminal is in the root directory of this project (the `Coding-For-MBA` folder) and your virtual environment is active. Then, execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   python Day_01_Introduction/helloworld.py
   ```

You will see the output of the business calculations printed to your console.

## üíª Exercises: Day 1

The exercises are designed to help you practice the fundamental concepts introduced in the script.

1. **Company Introduction:**

   - Create a new Python file named `my_solutions.py` in the `Day_01_Introduction` folder.
   - In your new script, use the `print()` function to introduce a fictional company.
   - Example: `print("Welcome to InnovateCorp Analytics")`

1. **Quarterly Sales Calculation:**

   - A company had quarterly sales of $110,000, $120,000, $135,000, and $140,000.
   - In your script, use the `print()` function to calculate and display the total annual sales. (Hint: you can do math right inside the print statement: `print(110000 + 120000 + ...)`).

1. **Checking Data Types in Business:**

   - Use the `type()` function to check the data types of the following business-related data points.
     - `1500` (e.g., number of units sold)
     - `1500.75` (e.g., a price or a financial metric)
     - `'InnovateCorp'` (e.g., a company name)
     - `True` (e.g., is the product in stock?)

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've just run your first refactored Python script and are on your way to becoming a data-savvy leader.
