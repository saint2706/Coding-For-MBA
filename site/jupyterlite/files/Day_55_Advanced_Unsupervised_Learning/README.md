# Day 55 â€“ Advanced Unsupervised Learning

Density-based clustering, hierarchical approaches, and modern embeddings unlock structure within messy
unlabelled datasets. Use the resources in this folder to:

- Compare DBSCAN and agglomerative clustering on reproducible customer segmentation datasets.
- Generate t-SNE and UMAP-style embeddings for storytelling-ready visualisations of high-dimensional data.
- Train compact autoencoders that reconstruct core signal while surfacing anomalies through reconstruction error.
- Combine reconstruction-based methods with classic isolation forests for a practical anomaly detection workflow.

Run `python Day_55_Advanced_Unsupervised_Learning/solutions.py` to reproduce the cluster assignments,
embeddings, and anomaly scores featured in the lesson.
