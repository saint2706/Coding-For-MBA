# Generated Documentation Site

This directory contains the built HTML files for the Coding for MBA documentation site, generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## Contents

- **index.html** - Main documentation homepage
- **lessons/** - All 67 lesson pages (Day 01-67)
- **assets/** - CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets
- **search/** - Search index for the documentation
- **sitemap.xml** - Site map for search engines

## How It's Generated

These files are automatically generated from the markdown source files in `docs/` and the Day_* lesson directories by running:

```bash
python tools/build_docs.py --html
```

Or separately:

```bash
# Generate lesson markdown files
python tools/build_docs.py

# Build HTML files
mkdocs build --strict
```

## GitHub Pages

These HTML files are served via GitHub Pages at: https://saint2706.github.io/Coding-For-MBA/

The site is automatically rebuilt and deployed by the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`) whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Local Preview

To preview the site locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## ⚠️ Important

**Do not manually edit files in this directory!** They are generated from the source markdown files and will be overwritten on the next build.

To update the documentation:
1. Edit the source files in `docs/` or `Day_*/README.md`
2. Run `python tools/build_docs.py --html` to regenerate
3. Commit both the source files and the generated HTML
