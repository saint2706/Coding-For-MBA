# Day 77 – BI Domain Analytics and Value Drivers

Day 77 bridges the roadmap's domain-specific BI topics with tangible stakeholder value stories.
The lesson groups the nodes into three facilitation tracks and anchors each in the language of
business outcomes:

- **Revenue-facing** – Sales, marketing, customer lifetime value, and risk/compliance teams all
  ground their dashboards in unit economics. The scenarios in `lesson.py` walk through marketing
  ROI, average revenue per customer, retention rate, fraud rate, and risk-adjusted revenue so the
  cohort can see how protective analytics keep gross revenue translating into cash.
- **Operational excellence** – Supply chain, inventory, maintenance, and production leads lean on
  throughput math. The walkthrough computes inventory turns, uptime percentage, first-pass yield,
  and units per hour to emphasize how operations analytics marry efficiency and quality control.
- **Industry verticals** – Finance, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, HR, and operations leaders
  speak in vertical KPIs. The lesson combines helper functions with the Fortune 1000 dataset to
  summarize operating margin, return rates, bed utilization, HR turnover, and manufacturing yield,
  showing how macro benchmarks contextualize departmental dashboards.

Use the script to narrate how generic BI techniques become stakeholder-relevant KPIs. Each
function demonstrates how to plug the roadmap topics into dashboards by pairing cleaned datasets
with helper calculations tailored to a domain conversation.
