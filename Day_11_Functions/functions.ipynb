    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 11: Functions - Creating Reusable Business Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "As you perform more complex analysis, you'll write the same code repeatedly. **Functions** are named, reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, helping you avoid repetition and write cleaner, more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Function Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition (`def`):** You define a function using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "- **Parameters:** Inputs to your function that allow you to pass data to it (e.g., `revenue`, `expenses`).\n",
    "- **`return` Statement:** Sends a value *back* from the function, so you can use the result in other parts of your code.\n",
    "- **Type Hinting:** A modern Python feature that lets you specify the expected data types for parameters and the return value (e.g., `def get_net_profit(revenue: float) -> float:`). This improves code clarity and helps prevent bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `functions.py`, is already well-structured, with each piece of business logic encapsulated in its own function. We've made a minor improvement by wrapping the example usage in a `main()` function, which is a standard convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_11_Functions/functions.py`. Examine the different functions like `get_net_profit()`, `calculate_commission()`, and `format_currency()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_11_Functions/functions.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_11.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 11\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Commission Calculator Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `calculate_commission` function is already created in `functions.py`.\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_11.py`), import this function: `from Day_11_Functions.functions import calculate_commission`.\n",
    "   - Call the function with a sample sales amount and print the returned commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Employee Bonus Eligibility Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import the `is_eligible_for_bonus` function.\n",
    "   - Call the function with a few different scenarios for `performance_rating` and `years_of_service` and print the `True`/`False` results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Advanced Currency Formatter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a new function `format_currency_with_symbol(amount, symbol='$')`.\n",
    "   - This function should take an amount and an optional `symbol` parameter that defaults to `'$'`.\n",
    "   - It should return a formatted string like `â‚¬1,250.50` if the symbol is `'â‚¬'`.\n",
    "   - Test your new function by calling it with and without the `symbol` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Great work!** Functions are the key to writing clean, organized, and professional code. By packaging your logic into reusable tools, you're moving from a simple scripter to a true programmer."
