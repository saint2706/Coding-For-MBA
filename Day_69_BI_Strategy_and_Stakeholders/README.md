# Day 69 – BI Strategy and Stakeholders

Day 69 extends the BI Analyst roadmap by pairing strategic constructs with the humans who bring them to life. The lesson gives participants a toolkit for translating the roadmap nodes into facilitation plans, stakeholder engagement tactics, and action-oriented guidance.

## Learning goals

- Differentiate operating model topics such as BI operations, stakeholder identification, and key business functions.
- Contrast operational, tactical, and strategic BI activities to align expectations and investment.
- Practice mapping stakeholder personas to the BI operating model that best reflects their needs.
- Capture facilitation notes and coaching prompts you can re-use across client engagements.

## Classroom flow

1. **Operating model orientation** – Facilitate a discussion on how BI teams structure the work, using the roadmap topics as anchors.
2. **Stakeholder mapping exercise** – Break cohorts into pairs to match stakeholder personas with the BI operations that unlock their outcomes.
3. **Strategy tier decisions** – Lead a dialogue about when to apply operational vs tactical vs strategic BI and what artifacts each requires.
4. **Action planning** – Summarize the commitments and metrics each stakeholder group should own after the session.

## Stakeholder mapping exercise

Use the following prompts during the exercise:

- *Marketing director*: Which BI operation clarifies campaign performance? Why?
- *Finance controller*: Which BI function keeps recurring reporting accurate and compliant?
- *Operations manager*: How does BI support day-to-day execution and exception handling?
- *Executive sponsor*: What strategic BI questions keep them focused on long-term growth?

Encourage learners to map each persona to the operating model and strategy tier that best serves their needs, then capture one actionable insight per persona.

## Facilitation tips

- Reinforce that operating models exist to keep stakeholders coordinated, not to create bureaucracy.
- Encourage participants to co-design escalation paths for when insights conflict with intuition.
- Close the session with a commitment from each stakeholder persona: what decision will they make differently because of the BI strategy?
