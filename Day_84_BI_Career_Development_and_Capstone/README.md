# Day 84 – BI Career Development and Capstone

> This lesson closes Phase 5 by converting the roadmap insights into a polished career
narrative. Pair it with [Day 83 – BI Career Assets](../Day_83_BI_Career_Assets/README.md)
and the planning prompts in [Day 84 – BI Roadmapping](../Day_84_BI_Roadmapping/README.md).

## Why it matters

A strong capstone bridges your project experience with employer expectations. Using the
roadmap ensures that the assets you build speak the language of BI hiring managers and
stakeholders.

## Capstone workflow

1. **Frame the business objective** – state the business question, success metrics, and
   stakeholder audience that will anchor your presentation.
2. **Design the solution storyline** – outline the analytics flow, highlight how each
   roadmap title becomes a tangible artifact, and document the collaboration or research
   you will showcase.
3. **Deliver and rehearse** – package the assets, rehearse the pitch, and prepare
   follow-up material such as interview responses or stakeholder FAQs.

## Career assets checklist

Use these roadmap-aligned prompts to plan the artifacts that demonstrate your value.
