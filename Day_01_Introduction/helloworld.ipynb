    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 1: Python for Business Analytics - First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, future business leader! You're about to take your first step into a larger world of data-driven decision-making. In today's business landscape, the ability to understand and leverage data is not just a technical skillâ€”it's a core competency for effective management. This course is designed specifically for MBA students like you. We'll skip the abstract computer science jargon and focus on one thing: **using Python as a powerful tool to solve real-world business problems.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need any prior coding experience. We'll start from zero and build your skills step-by-step. By the end of this 50-day journey, you'll be able to manipulate data, generate insights, and even build predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python for Business?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Lingua Franca of Data:** Python is the most widely used language for data science, machine learning, and analytics.\n",
    "1. **Automation of Tedious Tasks:** Automate cleaning messy Excel sheets, gathering web data, or generating weekly reports.\n",
    "1. **Powerful Analytics at Your Fingertips:** Python's extensive libraries allow for complex statistical analysis and compelling data visualizations.\n",
    "1. **Strategic Advantage:** Understanding the language of your data science team gives you a significant strategic advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, please follow the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) at the root of this repository. This will guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cloning the project.\n",
    "1. Setting up a virtual environment.\n",
    "1. Installing all the necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed those steps and activated your virtual environment, you are ready to start this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your First Python Script: A Business Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the code for today's lesson. The script for this lesson is `helloworld.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_01_Introduction/helloworld.py` in your code editor. You will see that the code is now organized into functions, which is a best practice for writing clean and reusable code.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** To run the script, make sure your terminal is in the root directory of this project (the `Coding-For-MBA` folder) and your virtual environment is active. Then, execute the script by running:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_01_Introduction/helloworld.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the output of the business calculations printed to your console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are designed to help you practice the fundamental concepts introduced in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Company Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a new Python file named `my_solutions.py` in the `Day_01_Introduction` folder.\n",
    "   - In your new script, use the `print()` function to introduce a fictional company.\n",
    "   - Example: `print(\"Welcome to InnovateCorp Analytics\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quarterly Sales Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A company had quarterly sales of $110,000, $120,000, $135,000, and $140,000.\n",
    "   - In your script, use the `print()` function to calculate and display the total annual sales. (Hint: you can do math right inside the print statement: `print(110000 + 120000 + ...)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking Data Types in Business:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use the `type()` function to check the data types of the following business-related data points.\n",
    "     - `1500` (e.g., number of units sold)\n",
    "     - `1500.75` (e.g., a price or a financial metric)\n",
    "     - `'InnovateCorp'` (e.g., a company name)\n",
    "     - `True` (e.g., is the product in stock?)\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've just run your first refactored Python script and are on your way to becoming a data-savvy leader."
