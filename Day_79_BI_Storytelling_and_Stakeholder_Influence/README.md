# Day 79 – BI Storytelling and Stakeholder Influence

Day 79 teaches analysts how to weave together storytelling craft and change leadership so executive audiences commit to action. The roadmap entries covering narrative assets, stakeholder dynamics, and soft skills are turned into facilitation-ready walkthroughs that demonstrate how to convert metrics into persuasive executive narratives.

## Learning goals

- Combine storytelling frameworks, executive summaries, and presentation design into reusable narrative assets.
- Translate BI metrics into audience-aware story arcs that call for a specific executive action.
- Map stakeholder, change, and project management levers into a single influence brief that supports adoption.
- Coach facilitators on the soft skills that sustain trust while guiding critical thinking in the room.

## Classroom flow

1. **Roadmap orientation** – Introduce the narrative asset and influence lever groupings so learners understand how the roadmap nodes reinforce one another.
2. **Story arc lab** – Walk teams through transforming a lagging metric into an executive-ready narrative, highlighting when to deploy storytelling, presentation, and dashboard assets.
3. **Influence brief build** – Co-create a stakeholder plan that pairs change management tactics with project milestones and business acumen talking points.
4. **Facilitation retro** – Reflect on which soft skills and critical thinking prompts kept the discussion grounded in outcomes.

## Storytelling walkthroughs

Use the `lesson.py` script to practice translating metrics into narratives:

- Showcase how a four-point drop in net revenue retention becomes a story arc with clear tension, decision, and reinforcement moments.
- Demonstrate the executive summary headline that links the insight to a concrete call to action.
- Connect the dashboard follow-up plan so leaders know how they will monitor progress post-meeting.

## Facilitation tips

- Start every walkthrough by clarifying the audience and the business question the metric answers before building slides.
- Pair each influence lever with a question that uncovers hidden risks (e.g., "What change fatigue might surface if we accelerate this project?").
- Encourage note-takers to capture the exact language stakeholders use; it becomes source material for executive summaries and follow-up communications.
- Close sessions by rehearsing the call to action aloud so facilitators hear whether the ask is compelling and achievable.
