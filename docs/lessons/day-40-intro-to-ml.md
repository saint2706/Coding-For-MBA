## Overview

This lesson introduces the machine learning workflow and highlights how evaluation techniques ensure reliable models. You'll generate data, configure cross-validation, train a linear model, and compute mean squared error metrics.

> **Prerequisites:** Install scikit-learn with `pip install scikit-learn` before running the exercises.

## Key Concepts

- **Learning Paradigms:** Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning cover most ML problems and inform how we collect data and labels.
- **Biasâ€“Variance Trade-off:** Balances model simplicity and flexibility; too much bias underfits, too much variance overfits.
- **Cross-Validation:** Splits data into multiple folds so every observation is used for both training and validation, yielding a robust performance estimate.

## Practice Exercises

1. **Dataset Generation:** `generate_dataset()` creates a noisy linear regression dataset for experimentation.
1. **Cross-Validation Setup:** `setup_kfold()` configures the resampling strategy, while `train_linear_regression()` and `evaluate_model()` encapsulate model training and scoring.
1. **Model Assessment:** `cross_validate_model()` runs the full loop and reports per-fold and average mean squared error.
