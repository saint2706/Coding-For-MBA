As you work on more complex projects, you'll find they have different requirements. Project A might need an older version of a library, while Project B needs the latest version. Installing everything globally on your computer leads to conflicts.

The professional solution is to use **virtual environments**.

## What is a Virtual Environment?

A virtual environment is an isolated, self-contained directory that holds a specific version of Python plus all the specific packages and libraries required for a particular project. Think of it as a clean, separate workspace for each project.

This is a **critical best practice** for any serious Python development because it makes your projects:

- **Isolated:** Prevents package versions from clashing between projects.
- **Reproducible:** Allows anyone to recreate the exact same environment your project needs to run correctly.

## How it Works: `venv` and `requirements.txt`

The main `README.md` file for this entire repository now contains the standard setup instructions for this project, which includes creating a virtual environment and installing the project's dependencies.

The key commands, which you should run from your terminal, are:

1. **Create Environment:** `python3 -m venv venv`

   - This creates a `venv` folder in your project directory.

1. **Activate Environment:**

   - **macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
   - **Windows:** `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   - Your terminal prompt will change to show `(venv)`, indicating it's active.

1. **Install Packages:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   - This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs the exact versions of all necessary packages into your active `venv`.

1. **Deactivate Environment:** `deactivate`

   - When you're done, this command returns you to your normal shell.

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 21

This lesson is about terminal commands, not Python scripts. The best way to learn is by doing.

1. **Create a New Project:**

   - On your computer, create a new folder called `my_test_project`.
   - Navigate into it using `cd my_test_project`.

1. **Initialize and Activate:**

   - Create a new virtual environment inside it: `python3 -m venv my_env`.
   - Activate the new environment.

1. **Install and Freeze:**

   - Install a package that is not in our main project, for example: `pip install "cowsay==5.0"`.
   - Generate a `requirements.txt` file for this new project using the `pip freeze` command. Open the file and see that `cowsay` is listed.

1. **Deactivate and Clean Up:**

   - Deactivate the environment. You can now delete the `my_test_project` folder.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've practiced one of the most important skills for professional Python development. Using virtual environments will save you from countless headaches and make your projects more robust and shareable.
