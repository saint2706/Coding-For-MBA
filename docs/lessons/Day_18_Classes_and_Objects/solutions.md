# ðŸ“˜ Day 18: Classes and Objects - Modeling Business Concepts

So far, we've organized our code with functions. But what if you want to model a real-world concept, like a "Customer," that has both data (name, email) and actions (calculate total spending)? For this, we use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and its building blocks: **classes** and **objects**.

## What are Classes and Objects?

- A **Class** is a blueprint for creating an object. It defines the data (attributes) and actions (methods) that the object will have. Think of `Car` as a class.
- An **Object** is an instance of a class. It's a concrete thing created from the blueprint. Your specific `toyota_camry` would be an object of the `Car` class.

This approach is powerful because it lets you bundle data and the functions that operate on that data together in a clean, logical way.

## Key Class Concepts

- **`__init__(self, ...)`:** The "initializer" or "constructor" method. It runs automatically when you create a new object and is used to set up its initial attributes.
- **`self`:** Represents the instance of the class itself. Inside a method, you use `self` to access the object's own attributes (e.g., `self.firstname`).
- **Attributes:** Variables that belong to an object (e.g., `person.firstname`).
- **Methods:** Functions that belong to an object (e.g., `person.account_balance()`).

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `CaO.py`, has been refactored for clarity and robustness.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_18_Classes_and_Objects/CaO.py`.
   - The `Statistics` class now gracefully handles empty data and potential errors when calculating the mode.
   - The `PersonAccount` class has been streamlined to add incomes and expenses via methods, which is a more standard object-oriented approach.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the classes instantiated and their methods called:
   ```bash
   python Day_18_Classes_and_Objects/CaO.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each class and its methods under various conditions:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_18.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 18

1. **Create a `Product` Class:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_18.py`), create a class named `Product`.
   - The `__init__` method should take `name`, `price`, and `initial_quantity` as arguments and store them as attributes.
   - Add a method `get_inventory_value()` that returns the total value of the product's inventory (`price * quantity`).
   - Add a method `restock(amount)` that increases the product's quantity.
   - Create an instance of your `Product` class, check its initial inventory value, restock it, and then check the new value.

1. **Extend the `PersonAccount` Class:**

   - Import the `PersonAccount` class from the lesson script.
   - Create an instance of the class for a new person.
   - Add several income and expense items using the `.add_income()` and `.add_expense()` methods.
   - Print the final account summary using the `.account_info()` method.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've learned the basics of object-oriented programming. This will enable you to write more organized, powerful, and scalable analytical scripts that model real-world business concepts.

```python
# Day 18: Classes and Objects - Solutions

from datetime import datetime
from typing import List

from CaO import PersonAccount

## Exercise 1 & 2: Create a `Car` class with a `get_age` method


class Car:
    def __init__(self, make: str, model: str, year: int):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self) -> None:
        print(f"Car Information: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")

    def get_age(self) -> int:
        current_year = datetime.now().year
        return current_year - self.year


# Example usage:
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
my_car.display_info()
print(f"The car is {my_car.get_age()} years old.")

## Exercise 3: Extend the `PersonAccount` class

# Create an enhanced PersonAccount instance with additional methods
# The PersonAccount class is imported from CaO.py

# Example usage:
person = PersonAccount(
    "John", "Doe", {"Salary": 5000, "Bonus": 1000}, {"Rent": 1500, "Food": 500}
)


# Additional methods that could be added to PersonAccount class:
def get_income_sources(account: PersonAccount) -> List[str]:
    """Get all income source names for a PersonAccount."""
    return list(account.incomes.keys())


def get_expense_sources(account: PersonAccount) -> List[str]:
    """Get all expense source names for a PersonAccount."""
    return list(account.expenses.keys())


print(f"Income sources: {get_income_sources(person)}")
print(f"Expense sources: {get_expense_sources(person)}")
print(f"Total income: {person.total_income()}")
print(f"Total expenses: {person.total_expense()}")
print(f"Account balance: {person.account_balance()}")

```
