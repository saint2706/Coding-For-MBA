In data analysis, you constantly create new lists by transforming or filtering existing ones. While
`for` loops work, Python provides a more concise, powerful, and often faster way to do this: a
**list comprehension**.

## The Syntax of List Comprehension

A list comprehension creates a new list in a single, readable line.

`new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]`

1. **`[expression ... ]`**: The brackets that create the new list.
1. **`expression`**: What to do with each item (e.g., `item * 1.1`, `item["name"]`).
1. **`for item in iterable`**: The loop part that iterates through the original list.
1. **`if condition` (Optional):** A filter that decides whether to include the item.

```python
# The for loop way
large_sales = []
for sale in sales:
    if sale > 1000:
        large_sales.append(sale)

# The list comprehension way
large_sales = [sale for sale in sales if sale > 1000]
```

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main
[README.md](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/blob/main/README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `list_comprehension.py`, has been refactored to place each list
comprehension task into its own testable function.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_12_List_Comprehension/list_comprehension.py`. Notice the functions
   `apply_price_increase()`, `filter_large_sales()`, and `get_top_sales_performers()`.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to
   see the functions in action:
   ```bash
   python Day_12_List_Comprehension/list_comprehension.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each
   function:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_12.py
   ```

## 💻 Exercises: Day 12

1. **Calculate Sales Commissions:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_12.py`), create a list of sales figures:
     `sales = [2500, 8000, 12000, 5500]`.
   - Write a function `calculate_commissions(sales_list, commission_rate)` that takes a list of
     sales and a rate.
   - Inside the function, use a list comprehension to return a new list of calculated commissions.
   - Call your function with a 15% commission rate (`0.15`) and print the result.

1. **Filter Products by Category:**

   - You have a list of product dictionaries (see below).
   - Create a function `filter_by_category(product_list, category)` that takes a list of products
     and a category name.
   - The function should use a list comprehension to return a new list containing only the *names*
     of products in the specified category.
   - Call your function with the category `"electronics"` and print the result.
     ```python
     products = [
         {"name": "Laptop", "category": "electronics"},
         {"name": "T-Shirt", "category": "apparel"},
         {"name": "Keyboard", "category": "electronics"}
     ]
     ```

1. **Format Prices for Display:**

   - You have a list of prices as floats: `prices = [49.99, 199.99, 19.95]`.
   - Use a list comprehension to create a new list called `display_prices`.
   - Each item in the new list should be a string, formatted as currency (e.g., `"$49.99"`).
   - Print the `display_prices` list.

🎉 **Excellent!** List comprehensions are a powerful tool for writing clean, efficient, and
professional Python code. They are heavily used in data analysis for quick and readable data
transformations.

Day 12: Elegant Data Manipulation with List Comprehensions (Refactored)

This script demonstrates how to use list comprehensions to
efficiently transform and filter lists of business data. This version
is refactored into functions for better organization and testability.
"""


def apply_price_increase(prices, increase_percentage):
    """
    Applies a percentage price increase to a list of prices
    using a list comprehension.

    List comprehensions are a concise way to create new lists by
    transforming each item in an existing list. They're faster and
    more "Pythonic" than traditional for loops.

    Syntax: [expression for item in iterable]

    Parameters
    ----------
    prices : list of float
        Original prices
    increase_percentage : float
        Percentage increase as decimal (e.g., 0.10 for 10%)

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        New prices with increase applied

    Example
    -------
    >>> apply_price_increase([100, 200], 0.10)
    [110.0, 220.0]
    """
    increase_multiplier = 1 + increase_percentage

    # List comprehension: [what_to_do_with_each_item for item in list]
    # This creates a new list by multiplying each price by the multiplier
    # Equivalent to a for loop but more concise:
    # new_prices = []
    # for price in prices:
    #     new_prices.append(price * increase_multiplier)
    return [price * increase_multiplier for price in prices]


def filter_large_sales(sales, threshold):
    """
    Filters a list of sales to find those above a given threshold
    using a list comprehension with a conditional.

    List comprehensions can also filter data by adding an 'if' condition.

    Syntax: [expression for item in iterable if condition]

    Parameters
    ----------
    sales : list of float
        List of sale amounts
    threshold : float
        Minimum sale amount to include

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        Sales that exceed the threshold

    Example
    -------
    >>> filter_large_sales([500, 1200, 800, 1500], 1000)
    [1200, 1500]
    """
    # List comprehension with filtering: [item for item in list if condition]
    # Only includes sales where the amount is greater than threshold
    # Equivalent traditional loop:
    # result = []
    # for sale in sales:
    #     if sale > threshold:
    #         result.append(sale)
    return [sale for sale in sales if sale > threshold]


def get_top_sales_performers(employees, sales_target):
    """
    Filters and transforms a list of employee dictionaries to get the
    names of top-performing sales staff.

    This demonstrates a more complex list comprehension that:
    1. Filters by multiple conditions (AND logic)
    2. Extracts just one field (name) from dictionaries

    Parameters
    ----------
    employees : list of dict
        List of employee dictionaries with 'name', 'department', 'quarterly_sales'
    sales_target : float
        Minimum sales to be considered top performer

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        Names of sales employees who exceeded the target

    Example
    -------
    >>> employees = [
    ...     {"name": "Alice", "department": "Sales", "quarterly_sales": 12000},
    ...     {"name": "Bob", "department": "Engineering", "quarterly_sales": 0},
    ... ]
    >>> get_top_sales_performers(employees, 10000)
    ['Alice']
    """
    # Complex list comprehension with multiple conditions:
    # [what_to_extract for item in list if condition1 and condition2]
    #
    # This extracts employee['name'] for each employee where:
    # 1. Their department is "Sales" AND
    # 2. Their quarterly_sales exceeds sales_target
    #
    # .get() with a default of 0 prevents errors if key is missing
