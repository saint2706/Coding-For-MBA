# ðŸ“˜ Day 26: Practical Statistics for Business Analysis

On Day 26 you expand beyond data wrangling and apply core statistical tools to
business datasets. The refactored lesson script now exposes reusable helper
functions for descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis
testing so you can integrate them directly into your own notebooks or projects.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main
[README.md](../../README.md) to create your virtual environment and install the
required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The `stats.py` module has been organized into testable functions that separate
computation from presentation.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_26_Statistics/stats.py` and look at the new
   helpers:
   - `load_sales_data()` reads `sales_data.csv` and removes missing rows.
   - `summarize_revenue()` returns key revenue metrics and the full
     `DataFrame.describe()` output.
   - `compute_correlations()` produces a correlation matrix for the numeric
     sales fields.
   - `run_ab_test()` wraps SciPy's independent t-test and reports whether the
     difference is statistically significant.
   - `build_revenue_distribution_chart()` visualises the revenue histogram as an
     interactive Plotly figure.
   - `build_correlation_heatmap()` turns the correlation matrix into an
     interactive heatmap with hover labels and colourbar explanations.
1. **Run the Script:** From the project root, execute the module to see the
   printed analysis that the helpers power.
   ```bash
   python Day_26_Statistics/stats.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** The automated tests create in-memory DataFrames and
   duration samples to validate each helper without touching disk.
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_26.py
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Explore the Interactive Notebooks

Static Matplotlib previews are great for reports, but sometimes you need to
hover over exact values or export a filtered view. Open the companion notebook
to try the Plotly charts side by side with their static counterparts:

1. Install notebook dependencies if you skipped them earlier:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook plotly
   ```
1. Launch Jupyter and open the walkthrough:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Day_26_Statistics/statistics_interactive.ipynb
   ```
1. Execute the notebook cells to compare the summary statistics, static plots,
   and the new interactive revenue distribution and correlation heatmap.

ðŸŽ‰ **Great job!** With these reusable statistics utilities you can move from
simple summaries to rigorous, testable insights in your analyses.

Day 26: Solutions to Exercises

```python

from pathlib import Path

import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# --- Exercise 1: Descriptive Statistics of Sales ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 1 ---")
resource_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
data_path = resource_dir / "sales_data.csv"

try:
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
    df.dropna(inplace=True)  # Clean the data first

    revenue = df["Revenue"]

    print(f"Mean Revenue: ${revenue.mean():,.2f}")
    print(f"Median Revenue: ${revenue.median():,.2f}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation of Revenue: ${revenue.std():,.2f}")
    print(f"Minimum Revenue: ${revenue.min():,.2f}")
    print(f"Maximum Revenue: ${revenue.max():,.2f}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: sales_data.csv not found. Keep the CSV beside this script.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 2: Correlation Analysis ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 2 ---")
if not df.empty:
    # Select only the numerical columns
    numerical_cols = df[["Units Sold", "Price", "Revenue"]]

    # Calculate the correlation matrix
    correlation_matrix = numerical_cols.corr()

    print("Correlation Matrix:")
    print(correlation_matrix)
    print(
        "\nAnswer: 'Units Sold' and 'Revenue' have the strongest positive correlation (0.93)."
    )
else:
    print("DataFrame not available for this exercise.")
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 3: A/B Test Analysis (T-Test) ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 3 ---")
group_a_durations = [10.5, 12.1, 11.8, 13.0, 12.5]
group_b_durations = [12.8, 13.5, 13.2, 14.0, 13.8]

print(f"Group A Durations: {group_a_durations}")
print(f"Group B Durations: {group_b_durations}")

# Perform the t-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(group_a_durations, group_b_durations)

print(f"\nP-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Conclusion based on the p-value
if p_value < 0.05:  # pyright: ignore[reportOperatorIssue]
    print(
        "Conclusion: The result is statistically significant. The two headlines likely have different effects on session duration."
    )
else:
    print(
        "Conclusion: The result is not statistically significant. We cannot conclude there is a difference between the headlines."
    )
print("-" * 20)
