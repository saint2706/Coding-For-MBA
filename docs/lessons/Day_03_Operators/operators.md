# ðŸ“˜ Day 3: Operators - The Tools for Business Calculation and Logic

An **operator** is a symbol that tells the computer to perform a specific mathematical or logical manipulation. For a business analyst, operators are the tools you'll use to calculate financial metrics, compare results, and create business rules.

## Key Operator Types

- **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`):** The foundation of any quantitative analysis, used for calculations like profit margin and compound interest.
- **Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`):** Used to assign and update values in variables, such as accumulating total sales.
- **Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`):** Used to compare two values, resulting in `True` or `False`. This is the basis for filtering data and making decisions.
- **Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`):** Used to combine conditional statements to create complex business rules, like determining bonus eligibility.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `operators.py`, has been refactored into functions to make the logic clear, reusable, and testable.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_03_Operators/operators.py`. Each business calculation or rule (e.g., `calculate_compound_interest()`, `check_bonus_eligibility()`) is now its own function.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
   ```bash
   python Day_03_Operators/operators.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_03.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 3

1. **Calculate Net Profit Margin:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_03.py`), create a function `calculate_net_profit_margin(revenue, expenses)`.
   - The function should return the net profit margin (`(revenue - expenses) / revenue`).
   - Call the function with a `revenue` of 1,200,000 and `total_expenses` of 850,000.
   - Print the result formatted as a percentage with two decimal places.

1. **Inventory Check Function:**

   - Create a function `check_reorder_status(inventory_count, low_stock_threshold, reorder_threshold)`.
   - The function should return a dictionary with two keys: `is_low_stock` (boolean) and `needs_reorder` (boolean).
   - Call the function with an `inventory_count` of 45, a `low_stock_threshold` of 50, and a `reorder_threshold` of 25. Print the results.

1. **Sales Bonus Eligibility Function:**

   - The logic for bonus eligibility is already in the `check_bonus_eligibility` function in `operators.py`.
   - In your own script, import this function: `from Day_03_Operators.operators import check_bonus_eligibility`.
   - Call the function with a few different scenarios for `sales`, `years_of_service`, and `top_performer_last_quarter` to see the results.

ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent work!** You're now equipped with the operators needed to perform the vast majority of business calculations and logical checks you'll encounter.

Day 3: Operators in Action for Business Analysis (Refactored)

This script demonstrates how different Python operators can be used
to perform business calculations and logical checks. This version is
refactored into functions for better organization and testability.

```python


def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n=1):
    """
    Calculates the final amount of an investment with compound interest.
    A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
    """
    # The ** operator is used for exponents
    final_amount = principal * (1 + rate / n) ** (n * time)
    return final_amount


def accumulate_sales(initial_sales, daily_sales):
    """
    Accumulates daily sales into a total.
    """
    total = initial_sales
    for sale in daily_sales:
        total += sale  # The += operator adds a value to a variable
    return total


def check_inventory_status(inventory_count, low_stock_threshold):
    """Checks if the inventory count is below the low stock threshold."""
    # The < operator checks if a value is less than another
    return inventory_count < low_stock_threshold


def check_sales_target(current_sales, sales_target):
    """Checks if the current sales have met or exceeded the sales target."""
    # The >= operator checks for "greater than or equal to"
    return current_sales >= sales_target


def check_bonus_eligibility(sales, years_of_service, top_performer_last_quarter):
    """
    Determines bonus eligibility based on complex business rules.
    The 'and' requires both conditions to be true.
    The 'or' allows either condition to be true.
    """
    is_eligible = (sales > 10000 and years_of_service > 2) or top_performer_last_quarter
