The final instalment of the MLOps arc closes the loop from deployment to
operations. After mastering persistence (Day 50), automation (Day 65),
and serving (Day 66), this lesson introduces the observability patterns
that keep models trustworthy in production.

## Learning goals

- **Data and concept drift detection** – Track feature distributions with
  population stability index (PSI), Kullback–Leibler divergence, or
  threshold-based heuristics that trigger alerts when inputs shift.
- **Automated retraining triggers** – Combine drift signals, performance
  metrics, and business guardrails to decide when to schedule a new
  training job.
- **Progressive delivery** – Roll out models with canary or shadow
  deployments, automatically rolling back if latency or accuracy
  regressions appear.
- **Observability tooling** – Instrument models with Prometheus metrics
  exporters, OpenTelemetry traces, and structured logging for rapid
  incident response.

## Hands-on practice

`solutions.py` provides synthetic drift generators, simple detection
algorithms, and a canary analysis helper. These components emit metrics
that could be scraped by Prometheus or pushed to OpenTelemetry
collectors, illustrating how to connect monitoring to automated decision
systems.

Run the script to see drift alerts bubble up:

```bash
python Day_67_Model_Monitoring_and_Reliability/solutions.py
```

`tests/test_day_67.py` feeds controlled distribution shifts through the
helpers and confirms that alerts fire, retraining queues populate, and
canary verdicts respect latency/accuracy thresholds.

## Extend the exercise

- Replace the heuristic drift detector with `alibi-detect`, `evidently`,
  or scikit-multiflow to monitor complex multivariate shifts.
- Export the observability payloads to Prometheus using `prometheus- client` counters, gauges, and histograms.
- Emit OpenTelemetry traces that attach prediction metadata and user
  identifiers for distributed tracing across microservices.
- Integrate human-in-the-loop acknowledgement by forwarding alerts to an
  incident management platform.
