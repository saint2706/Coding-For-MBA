# ðŸ“˜ Day 17: Regular Expressions for Text Pattern Matching

Often, the text data you need to analyze isn't perfectly structured. You might need to find all the invoice numbers in a document, extract all email addresses from a messy text block, or validate that a product code follows a specific format. For these tasks, we use **regular expressions** (regex).

## What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's like a mini-language for finding and manipulating text. While it can look intimidating at first, a few key patterns can solve most common business problems.

- `\d+`: Matches one or more digits (e.g., `123`).
- `[a-z]+`: Matches one or more lowercase letters.
- `\s`: Matches a whitespace character.
- `\b`: Matches a word boundary.
- `[]`: Defines a character set (e.g., `[abc]` matches 'a', 'b', or 'c').
- `[^...]`: Matches anything *not* in the character set.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `regex.py`, has been refactored to place each regex task into its own testable function.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py`. Examine functions like `find_most_common_words()`, `extract_and_analyze_numbers()`, `is_valid_python_variable()`, and `clean_text_advanced()`.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
   ```bash
   python Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each regex function:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_17.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 17

1. **Extract All Numbers from a String:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_17.py`), you have a string: `text = "Order #123 was placed for $49.99. The order contains 3 items."`
   - Import the `extract_and_analyze_numbers` function from the lesson script. Note that it only extracts integers. Can you modify the regex inside it to extract floating-point numbers as well?
   - Call the function and print the extracted numbers.

1. **Validate a Product Code:**

   - A valid product code must follow the format `PROD-XXXX`, where `X` is a digit.
   - Create a function `is_valid_product_code(code)` that returns `True` if the code is valid and `False` otherwise.
   - Use the `re.fullmatch(pattern, string)` function. Your pattern should look something like `r'PROD-\d{4}'`. (`\d{4}` means exactly four digits).
   - Test your function with `"PROD-1234"` (valid) and `"PROD-123"` (invalid).

1. **Clean Up a Messy Sentence:**

   - You have a sentence with extra symbols: `sentence = "Contact us... at (support@example.com)!"`
   - Import and use the `clean_text_advanced` function from the lesson to remove the punctuation and symbols.
   - Print the cleaned sentence.

ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** Regular expressions are a fundamental tool for any data analyst who works with text. They provide a powerful and efficient way to clean, validate, and extract information from unstructured data.

from collections import Counter

## Exercise 1: Find all numbers in a string

para = """The position of some particles on the horizontal x-axis are -12, -4, -3 and -1 in the negative direction,
0 at origin, 4 and 8 in the positive direction. """

num_list = list(map(int, re.findall(r"[-+]?[.]?[\d]+", para)))
print("Numbers found in the string:", num_list)


## Exercise 2: Validate a variable name


def is_valid_variable(potential_variable):
    if re.search(r"^[a-zA-Z_]\w*$", potential_variable):
        return True
    else:
        return False


print("Is '_name' a valid variable?", is_valid_variable("_name"))  # Expected: True
print(
    "Is 'first_name' a valid variable?", is_valid_variable("first_name")
)  # Expected: True
print("Is '1name' a valid variable?", is_valid_variable("1name"))  # Expected: False
print("Is 'name-1' a valid variable?", is_valid_variable("name-1"))  # Expected: False


## Exercise 3: Clean up a messy sentence

sentence = """%I $am@% a %tea@cher%, &and& I lo%#ve %tea@ching%;. There $is nothing; &as& mo@re rewarding as
educa@ting &and& @emp%o@wering peo@ple. ;I found tea@ching m%o@re interesting tha@n any other %jo@bs. %Do@es thi%s

    text = re.sub(r"\[.*?]", "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"https?://\S+|www\.\S+", "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"<.*?>+", "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"[%s]" % re.escape(string.punctuation), "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"\n", "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"\w*\d\w*", "", text)
    return text


def most_common_words(text, n):
    split_it = text.split()
    return Counter(split_it).most_common(n)

print("Top 3 most common words:", most_common_words(cleaned_sentence, 3))
