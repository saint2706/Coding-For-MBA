# ðŸ“˜ Day 17: Regular Expressions for Text Pattern Matching

Often, the text data you need to analyze isn't perfectly structured. You might need to find all the invoice numbers in a document, extract all email addresses from a messy text block, or validate that a product code follows a specific format. For these tasks, we use **regular expressions** (regex).

## What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's like a mini-language for finding and manipulating text. While it can look intimidating at first, a few key patterns can solve most common business problems.

- `\d+`: Matches one or more digits (e.g., `123`).
- `[a-z]+`: Matches one or more lowercase letters.
- `\s`: Matches a whitespace character.
- `\b`: Matches a word boundary.
- `[]`: Defines a character set (e.g., `[abc]` matches 'a', 'b', or 'c').
- `[^...]`: Matches anything *not* in the character set.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `regex.py`, has been refactored to place each regex task into its own testable function.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py`. Examine functions like `find_most_common_words()`, `extract_and_analyze_numbers()`, `is_valid_python_variable()`, and `clean_text_advanced()`.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
   ```bash
   python Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each regex function:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_17.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 17

1. **Extract All Numbers from a String:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_17.py`), you have a string: `text = "Order #123 was placed for $49.99. The order contains 3 items."`
   - Import the `extract_and_analyze_numbers` function from the lesson script. Note that it only extracts integers. Can you modify the regex inside it to extract floating-point numbers as well?
   - Call the function and print the extracted numbers.

1. **Validate a Product Code:**

   - A valid product code must follow the format `PROD-XXXX`, where `X` is a digit.
   - Create a function `is_valid_product_code(code)` that returns `True` if the code is valid and `False` otherwise.
   - Use the `re.fullmatch(pattern, string)` function. Your pattern should look something like `r'PROD-\d{4}'`. (`\d{4}` means exactly four digits).
   - Test your function with `"PROD-1234"` (valid) and `"PROD-123"` (invalid).

1. **Clean Up a Messy Sentence:**

   - You have a sentence with extra symbols: `sentence = "Contact us... at (support@example.com)!"`
   - Import and use the `clean_text_advanced` function from the lesson to remove the punctuation and symbols.
   - Print the cleaned sentence.

ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** Regular expressions are a fundamental tool for any data analyst who works with text. They provide a powerful and efficient way to clean, validate, and extract information from unstructured data.

Day 17: Using Regular Expressions for Text Pattern Matching (Refactored)

This script demonstrates how to use the 're' module for common
business text processing tasks like finding patterns, validating text,
and cleaning data. This version is refactored into testable functions.

```python

def find_most_common_words(text: str, top_n: int) -> List[Tuple[str, int]]:
    """
    Finds the most common words in a given text string.
    The text is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed before counting.
    """

    words = re.findall(r"\b[a-z]+\b", text.lower())
    return Counter(words).most_common(top_n)

    """
    Extracts all integer numbers from a text and returns the sorted list
    and the distance between the maximum and minimum numbers.

    numbers = [int(n) for n in re.findall(r"-?\d+", text)]
    if not numbers:
        return {"sorted_numbers": [], "distance": 0}

    numbers.sort()
    distance = numbers[-1] - numbers[0]
    return {"sorted_numbers": numbers, "distance": distance}


def is_valid_python_variable(name: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if a string is a valid Python variable name using regex.
    Valid: starts with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.
    """
    # ^[a-zA-Z_] matches the start of the string with a letter or underscore.
    # \w* matches zero or more "word" characters (letters, numbers, underscore).

    (except spaces) and converting to lowercase.
