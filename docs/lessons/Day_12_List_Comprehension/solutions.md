# ðŸ“˜ Day 12: List Comprehension - Elegant Data Manipulation

In data analysis, you constantly create new lists by transforming or filtering existing ones. While `for` loops work, Python provides a more concise, powerful, and often faster way to do this: a **list comprehension**.

## The Syntax of List Comprehension

A list comprehension creates a new list in a single, readable line.

`new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]`

1. **`[expression ... ]`**: The brackets that create the new list.
1. **`expression`**: What to do with each item (e.g., `item * 1.1`, `item["name"]`).
1. **`for item in iterable`**: The loop part that iterates through the original list.
1. **`if condition` (Optional):** A filter that decides whether to include the item.

```python
# The for loop way
large_sales = []
for sale in sales:
    if sale > 1000:
        large_sales.append(sale)

# The list comprehension way
large_sales = [sale for sale in sales if sale > 1000]
```

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `list_comprehension.py`, has been refactored to place each list comprehension task into its own testable function.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_12_List_Comprehension/list_comprehension.py`. Notice the functions `apply_price_increase()`, `filter_large_sales()`, and `get_top_sales_performers()`.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
   ```bash
   python Day_12_List_Comprehension/list_comprehension.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_12.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 12

1. **Calculate Sales Commissions:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_12.py`), create a list of sales figures: `sales = [2500, 8000, 12000, 5500]`.
   - Write a function `calculate_commissions(sales_list, commission_rate)` that takes a list of sales and a rate.
   - Inside the function, use a list comprehension to return a new list of calculated commissions.
   - Call your function with a 15% commission rate (`0.15`) and print the result.

1. **Filter Products by Category:**

   - You have a list of product dictionaries (see below).
   - Create a function `filter_by_category(product_list, category)` that takes a list of products and a category name.
   - The function should use a list comprehension to return a new list containing only the *names* of products in the specified category.
   - Call your function with the category `"electronics"` and print the result.
     ```python
     products = [
         {"name": "Laptop", "category": "electronics"},
         {"name": "T-Shirt", "category": "apparel"},
         {"name": "Keyboard", "category": "electronics"}
     ]
     ```

1. **Format Prices for Display:**

   - You have a list of prices as floats: `prices = [49.99, 199.99, 19.95]`.
   - Use a list comprehension to create a new list called `display_prices`.
   - Each item in the new list should be a string, formatted as currency (e.g., `"$49.99"`).
   - Print the `display_prices` list.

ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** List comprehensions are a powerful tool for writing clean, efficient, and professional Python code. They are heavily used in data analysis for quick and readable data transformations.

Day 12: Solutions to Exercises

```python

# --- Exercise 1: Calculate Sales Commissions ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 1 ---")
sales = [2500, 8000, 12000, 5500]
commission_rate = 0.10

# [expression for item in iterable]
# The expression is the calculation for each sale.
commissions = [sale * commission_rate for sale in sales]

print(f"Original sales: {sales}")
print(f"Calculated commissions (10%): {commissions}")
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 2: Filter Products by Category ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 2 ---")
products = [
    {"name": "Laptop", "category": "electronics"},
    {"name": "T-Shirt", "category": "apparel"},
    {"name": "Keyboard", "category": "electronics"},
    {"name": "Coffee Mug", "category": "homeware"},
    {"name": "Webcam", "category": "electronics"},
]

# [expression for item in iterable if condition]
# The expression is the product's name.
# The condition checks if the product's category is 'electronics'.
electronic_products = [
    product["name"] for product in products if product["category"] == "electronics"
]

print(f"All products: {products}")
print(f"Electronic products only: {electronic_products}")
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 3: Format Prices for Display ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 3 ---")
prices = [49.99, 199.99, 19.95, 24.50, 12.00]

# The expression is an f-string that formats each price.
display_prices = [f"${price:,.2f}" for price in prices]

print(f"Original prices (float): {prices}")
print(f"Display prices (string): {display_prices}")
print("-" * 20)

```
