Seasonality-aware forecasting keeps plans grounded in data rather than gut feel. The lesson materials show
how to:

- Generate seeded seasonal datasets for reproducible ARIMA and exponential smoothing experiments.
- Fit classic ARIMA/SARIMAX models alongside Prophet-style trend/seasonality decompositions built with statsmodels.
- Evaluate forecasts with rolling-origin backtests that compute MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and sMAPE simultaneously.
- Visualise forecast intervals and compare competing models on demand and revenue scenarios.

Launch `python Day_56_Time_Series_and_Forecasting/solutions.py` to train the baseline models and print
metric summaries for the synthetic workloads.
