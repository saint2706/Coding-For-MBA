Understand how experimentation and counterfactual reasoning quantify impact. After this lesson you will:

- Estimate average treatment effects (ATE) from randomized A/B tests.
- Learn propensity score workflows for observational studies.
- Implement double machine learning with cross-fitted residualization.
- Build two-model uplift estimators to target incremental responders.

Run `python Day_63_Causal_Inference_and_Uplift/solutions.py` to generate synthetic treatment data, estimate effects with multiple techniques, and visualise uplift segmentations.
