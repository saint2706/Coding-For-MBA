# ðŸ“˜ Day 14: Modules - Organizing Your Business Logic

As your projects grow, you need a way to organize your code. In Python, we do this with **modules**. A module is simply a Python file (`.py`) containing functions and variables. By grouping related functions into modules, you create a clean, maintainable, and scalable project.

## Why Use Modules?

- **Organization:** Keeps related code together (e.g., all financial calculations in `financials.py`).
- **Reusability:** Import your custom modules into any project.
- **Readability:** Makes your main script shorter and easier to understand.

## How to Import Modules

**1. Import the entire module (recommended):**
This is the most common way. You access functions using the `module_name.function_name` syntax.

```python
import business_logic as bl
roi = bl.calculate_roi(50000, 10000)
```

**2. Import a specific function:**
If you only need one or two functions from a large module.

```python
from business_logic import calculate_roi
roi = calculate_roi(50000, 10000)
```

## Python's Built-in Modules

Python comes with a huge **Standard Library** of built-in modules, including:

- `math`: For advanced mathematical functions (`math.sqrt()`).
- `datetime`: Essential for working with dates and times.
- `random`: For generating random numbers (useful for sampling).

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The code for this lesson is split into two files:

- `business_logic.py`: A module containing reusable functions.
- `modules.py`: The main script that imports and uses the `business_logic` module.

We have refactored `modules.py` to wrap its logic in functions and deleted a redundant, unused module file.

1. **Review the Code:** Open both `Day_14_Modules/business_logic.py` and `Day_14_Modules/modules.py`. See how the main script imports and uses the functions defined in the module.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the main script:
   ```bash
   python Day_14_Modules/modules.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of the functions in the `business_logic` module:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_14.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 14

1. **Create Your Own Module:**

   - Create a new file named `text_tools.py`.
   - Inside this file, define a function `count_characters(text)` that returns the length of a string.
   - Create a second file, `main_report.py`.
   - In `main_report.py`, import your `text_tools` module and use your function to count the characters in a sample sentence.

1. **Use the `datetime` Module:**

   - In a new script, `import` the `datetime` module.
   - Get the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.
   - Print the current date.
   - Print just the current year from the date object (e.g., `my_date.year`).

1. **Use the `math` Module:**

   - A company's sales are growing by the square root of its marketing budget.
   - `import` the `math` module.
   - Create a variable `marketing_budget = 100000`.
   - Use `math.sqrt()` to calculate the growth factor and print the result.

ðŸŽ‰ **Well done!** You've learned how to organize your code into modules. This is a critical skill for building any project that's more than a few dozen lines long.

Day 14: Solutions to Exercises.

```python

import datetime
import math

import finance_tools as ft

# --- Exercise 1: Create a Finance Module ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 1 ---")

# --- Call functions from the module ---
investment = 150000
profit = 25000
roi = ft.calculate_roi(investment, profit)
print(
    f"ROI for a ${investment:,.2f} investment with ${profit:,.2f} profit is: {roi:.2f}%"
)

principal = 10000
rate = 0.05
years = 10
future_value = ft.calculate_future_value(principal, rate, years)
print(
    f"Future value of ${principal:,.2f} after {years} years at a {rate * 100}% rate is: ${future_value:,.2f}"
)
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 2: Use the `datetime` Module ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 2 ---")
# import the module

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()

print(f"Current full date and time: {now}")
print(f"Current date only: {now.date()}")
print(f"Current year: {now.year}")
print(f"Current month: {now.month}")
print(f"Current day: {now.day}")
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 3: Use the `math` Module ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 3 ---")
# import the module

marketing_budget = 100000
# Use the sqrt function from the math module
growth_factor = math.sqrt(marketing_budget)

print(
    f"The growth factor for a marketing budget of ${marketing_budget:,.2f} is {growth_factor:.2f}."
)
print("-" * 20)

```
