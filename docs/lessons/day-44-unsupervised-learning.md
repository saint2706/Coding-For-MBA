## Overview

Day 44 introduces two foundational unsupervised learning workflows:

- **K-Means clustering** groups unlabeled observations into clusters using
  distance to learned centroids.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** compresses high-dimensional data
  into a smaller number of orthogonal components for easier visualization
  and downstream modeling.

Install scikit-learn before running the examples:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## What's inside

- `solutions.py` – reusable functions for generating blob data, fitting
  K-Means, and projecting datasets with PCA. Executing the file still
  creates the original visualisations.
- `README.md` – lesson summary (this document).

## Running the lesson script

Execute the scripted walkthrough, which will save clustering and PCA plots
to the project directory:

```bash
python Day_44_Unsupervised_Learning/solutions.py
```

## Running the tests

Automated tests validate the reusable helpers. Run just the Day 44 checks
with:

```bash
pytest tests/test_day_44.py
```

To execute the entire suite, simply call `pytest` from the repository
root.

## Further exploration

- Experiment with different numbers of clusters in `fit_kmeans` to observe
  how centroids move.
- Try increasing the number of PCA components and inspect the cumulative
  explained variance to decide how many dimensions to keep.
