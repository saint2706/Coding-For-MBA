# ðŸ“˜ Day 4: Working with Text Data - Strings

In business analytics, text data is everywhereâ€”customer names, product reviews, addresses, and report narratives. In Python, we handle text using **strings**.

## Key String Concepts

- **F-Strings:** The modern and most readable way to format strings. They let you embed variables and expressions directly inside a string.
  ```python
  report_summary = f"Company: {company_name}, Revenue: ${revenue}"
  ```
- **String Methods:** Built-in functions attached to strings that let you manipulate them. They are essential for data cleaning and preparation.

| Method | Description | Business Use Case |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `.lower()`/`.upper()` | Converts case. | Standardizing categories. |
| `.strip()` | Removes whitespace from the beginning and end. | Cleaning user-entered data. |
| `.replace()` | Replaces a substring with another. | Correcting or reformatting data. |
| `.split()` | Splits the string into a list of substrings. | Parsing comma-separated data. |
| `.startswith()`| Checks if the string starts with a substring. | Identifying invoice numbers. |
| `.endswith()` | Checks if the string ends with a substring. | Checking file types. |

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `strings.py`, has been refactored into functions to make each string manipulation a reusable and testable unit of logic.

1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_04_Strings/strings.py`. Each data transformation (e.g., `generate_report_header()`, `clean_and_format_name()`) is now its own function.
1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:
   ```bash
   python Day_04_Strings/strings.py
   ```
1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_day_04.py
   ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 4

1. **Generate a Report Header:**

   - In a new script (`my_solutions_04.py`), create a function `format_report_title(title, date)`.
   - The function should take a title string and a date string and return a formatted header like: `--- MONTHLY MARKETING REPORT: 2024-07 ---`.
   - Call the function and print the result.

1. **Clean Up Product Codes:**

   - You have a list of raw product codes: `[" prod-001 ", "prod-002", " Prod-003 "]`.
   - Create a function `clean_product_codes(codes)` that takes a list of codes.
   - Inside the function, loop through the list, and for each code, remove whitespace and convert it to uppercase.
   - The function should return a new list of cleaned codes.
   - Call the function and print the cleaned list.

1. **Validate Email Addresses:**

   - Create a function `is_valid_email(email)` that performs two simple checks:
     - Does the email contain an `@` symbol?
     - Does the email end with `.com`?
   - The function should return `True` if both conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - Test your function with a valid email (`"test@example.com"`) and an invalid one (`"test-example.com"`).

ðŸŽ‰ **Fantastic!** You can now manipulate text data, which is a massive part of any real-world data analysis task. Cleaning, formatting, and parsing strings are skills you'll use every single day.

Day 4: Solutions to Exercises

```python

# --- Exercise 1: Generate a Report Header ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 1 ---")
report_title = "Quarterly Sales Report"
fiscal_year = 2024

# Using .upper() to make the title all caps for emphasis
# and an f-string to combine everything.
header = f"*** {report_title.upper()} - FY{fiscal_year} ***"
print(header)
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 2: Clean Up Customer Data ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 2 ---")
customer_name = "  john doe  "

# .strip() removes the leading/trailing whitespace
# .title() capitalizes the first letter of each word
cleaned_name = customer_name.strip().title()

print(f"Original name: '{customer_name}'")
print(f"Cleaned name: '{cleaned_name}'")
print("-" * 20)


# --- Exercise 3: Parse Product SKU ---
print("--- Solution to Exercise 3 ---")
sku = "PROD-GADGET-001"

# .split('-') breaks the string into a list of substrings,
# using the hyphen as the separator.
sku_parts = sku.split("-")

# We can access the parts of the list by their index.
product_type = sku_parts[0]
product_name = sku_parts[1]
product_id = sku_parts[2]

print(f"Original SKU: {sku}")
print(f"Product Type: {product_type}")
print(f"Product Name: {product_name}")
print(f"Product ID: {product_id}")
print("-" * 20)

```
