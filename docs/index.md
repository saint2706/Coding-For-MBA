# Coding for MBA Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation hub for the **Coding for MBA** curriculum. This MkDocs-powered site pulls content directly from the repository so you can:

- Navigate the entire 67-day learning path in one place.
- Read every lesson summary without digging through folders.
- Jump straight into the companion notebooks or Python scripts for each topic.

!!! tip "Prefer a darker UI?"
    Use the theme toggle in the header to switch between the light and dark palettes.

## What's inside

- **Machine Learning Curriculum** – Phased roadmap that explains how the Day 40–67 sequence ladders into an end-to-end ML capability.
- **Lessons** – Direct access to every `Day_*` lesson README, enhanced with quick links to the supporting notebooks and scripts.
- **Accessible lesson exports** – Screen-reader-ready HTML and Markdown versions of every notebook live under [`docs/lessons/`](./lessons/) for offline or assistive-technology-first study.

## Contributing updates

Contributions are welcome! See the [repository README](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/blob/main/README.md) for setup instructions and the documentation contribution workflow.
