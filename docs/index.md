Welcome to the official documentation hub for the **Coding for MBA** curriculum. This static site pulls content directly from the repository so you can:

- Navigate the entire 67-day learning path in one place.
- Read every lesson summary without digging through folders.
- Jump straight into the companion notebooks or Python scripts for each topic.

Use the navigation menu to explore the machine learning roadmap or drill into the individual day lessons. New content is published automatically whenever changes land on the `main` branch.

## What's inside

- **Machine Learning Curriculum** – Phased roadmap that explains how the Day 40–67 sequence ladders into an end-to-end ML capability.
- **Lessons** – Direct access to every `Day_*` lesson README, enhanced with quick links to the supporting notebooks and scripts.

## Contributing updates

Contributions are welcome! See the [repository README](https://github.com/saint2706/Coding-For-MBA/blob/main/README.md) for setup instructions and the documentation contribution workflow.
