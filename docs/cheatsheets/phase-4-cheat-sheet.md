# Phase 4 Cheat Sheet â€” Advanced ML & MLOps (Days 55-67)

> Ship trustworthy, scalable AI systems. Phase 4 emphasises governance, automation, and emerging model families for strategic edge.

## Core Outcomes

- Deploy and monitor advanced models: transformers, generative AI, graph learning, reinforcement learning.
- Manage experimentation pipelines, CI/CD automation, and reproducible training infrastructure.
- Implement fairness, interpretability, and causal inference guardrails to satisfy executives and regulators.
- Build production-grade serving layers (batch + real-time) with observability and rollback strategies.
- Design monitoring plans that track model/data drift, performance decay, and ethical KPIs.

## Production-Ready Lifecycle

1. **Packaging** â€“ Containerise models (`Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`), freeze dependencies, capture artefacts.
2. **Automation** â€“ Use CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Airflow, Prefect) to orchestrate training, testing, and deployment.
3. **Deployment** â€“ Choose fit-for-purpose channels: REST APIs, streaming consumers, batch scoring jobs, or edge devices.
4. **Governance** â€“ Maintain model cards, data lineage, and approval checklists. Integrate fairness & bias audits.
5. **Monitoring** â€“ Track latency, throughput, accuracy, calibration, drift, and business KPIs. Trigger alerts and fallbacks.
6. **Feedback loop** â€“ Capture human-in-the-loop labels, log predictions, and continuously retrain when thresholds are breached.

## Advanced Technique Highlights

| Topic | Use Case | Key Moves |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Transformers | Text summarisation, Q&A, document intelligence | Fine-tune with transfer learning; manage token budgets and hallucination risk. |
| Generative Models | Marketing copy, scenario simulation, data augmentation | Guardrails: prompt templates, content filters, human review checkpoints. |
| Graph Learning | Customer networks, supply chain risk, fraud rings | Build graph features (centrality, community), leverage GraphSAGE/GAT for inductive learning. |
| Reinforcement Learning | Pricing strategies, operations optimisation | Define reward shaping with business KPIs; run offline evaluation before live testing. |
| Causal Inference | Campaign uplift, treatment effect | Use uplift models, doubly robust estimators, or causal forests; validate assumptions (ignorability, overlap). |

## Risk & Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Maintain dataset documentation with provenance, consent, and refresh cadence.
- [ ] Run fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity) and mitigation strategies when gaps appear.
- [ ] Stress-test against adversarial or out-of-distribution samples; log anomalies.
- [ ] Establish rollback plans and SLA thresholds for each deployment pathway.
- [ ] Socialise a communication plan for incidents, including exec briefings and customer messaging.

## Business Wins to Target

- Automated marketing content assistant with human-in-the-loop approval queue.
- Graph-based lead scoring that identifies relationship clusters sales can activate.
- Real-time fraud or risk scoring pipeline with latency SLOs and adaptive retraining.
- Causal uplift model that guides personalised promotions and measures incremental lift.

## 30-Minute Refresh Sprint

1. **Ops drill (10 min):** Sketch the CI/CD stages for retraining and deploying a recommendation model.
2. **Monitoring (10 min):** Define metrics, alert thresholds, and dashboards for a production NLP service.
3. **Ethics brief (10 min):** Summarise fairness risks, governance controls, and escalation paths for executives.
