# GitHub Discussions Playbook

Create a welcoming learner hub by enabling GitHub Discussions on the repository and giving learners a clear sense of how to participate.

## 1. Enable and Configure Discussions

1. Navigate to **Settings â†’ General â†’ Discussions** in the GitHub repository.
2. Check **Enable discussions** and select the template **Q&A** to seed the space with best-practice categories.
3. Add the following custom categories to align with the cohort experience:
   - **Announcements** *(Category type: Announcement)* â€“ official updates, milestone releases, and cohort kickoff posts.
   - **Help Desk** *(Category type: Q&A)* â€“ learner questions about lessons, tooling, or troubleshooting.
   - **Show and Tell** *(Category type: Open ended)* â€“ space to share mini-projects, wins, and reflections.
   - **Study Groups** *(Category type: Open ended)* â€“ coordinate peer-led sessions, accountability partners, or office hours.
   - **Feedback & Ideas** *(Category type: Idea)* â€“ collect feature requests, lesson improvements, and documentation suggestions.
4. Seed each category with a pinned starter topic to model tone and expectations (examples below).
5. Update the repository description or README badge row with a **Discussions** link for fast access.

## 2. Launch Announcement Template

Use this message (adapted to your voice) as the kickoff post in the **Announcements** category:

> ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Coding for MBA learner community! This space is your hub for asking questions, celebrating wins, and shaping the roadmap. Introduce yourself in the "Welcome thread," drop questions in **Help Desk**, and let us know what you're building in **Show and Tell**. We're excited to learn with you!

Encourage learners to subscribe to the announcement thread to receive important notifications.

## 3. Community Guidelines Snapshot

Share the following principles in a pinned topic within **Announcements** or link to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file:

- **Be specific:** Give context, include lesson numbers, and describe expected vs. actual behavior.
- **Practice kindness:** Assume positive intent, celebrate diverse backgrounds, and offer constructive feedback.
- **Close the loop:** Mark questions as answered by selecting the accepted response so future learners benefit.
- **Keep it organized:** Use tags (e.g., `lesson-21`, `mlops`, `beginner-help`) to help others discover discussions.
- **Respect privacy:** Share only anonymized business data or synthetic datasets when discussing projects.

## 4. Moderation & Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Suggested Owners |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **Community Host** | Welcome newcomers, post weekly roundups, curate unanswered questions. | Curriculum maintainers |
| **Subject-Matter Guides** | Provide verified answers for specific curriculum phases (e.g., Data Foundations, ML Ops). | Volunteer alumni or TAs |
| **Automation Bot (optional)** | Remind learners about open questions, tag threads without activity, and prompt feedback. | GitHub Action or Probot app |

Set a moderation rhythm:

- Review new discussions 2â€“3 times per week.
- Acknowledge new posts within 24 hours, even if only to say "Thanks, we'll take a look."
- Archive or convert off-topic threads into issues if they represent bugs or feature requests.

## 5. Engagement Rituals

- **Weekly check-in:** Post a Monday thread asking "What are you focusing on this week?"
- **Demo Friday:** Invite learners to share projects, dashboards, or analysis wins.
- **Curriculum office hours:** Host a live session once per month and summarize takeaways in Discussions.
- **Monthly retrospective:** Collect "Start/Stop/Continue" feedback in the **Feedback & Ideas** category.

## 6. Metrics to Monitor

Track community health indicators directly from GitHub Insights or manual exports:

- New members posting or commenting per week.
- Ratio of answered vs. unanswered questions in **Help Desk**.
- Time-to-first-response for support questions.
- Popular topics or tags driving engagement.
- Suggestions converted into accepted GitHub issues or pull requests.

## 7. Suggested Starter Topics

Use these ideas to seed each category:

- **Announcements:** "Welcome to the Coding for MBA Learner Community" *(pinned)*
- **Help Desk:** "How to request feedback on your Day 30 web scraping project"
- **Show and Tell:** "Share your business insight dashboards"
- **Study Groups:** "Forming accountability squads for Phase 2"
- **Feedback & Ideas:** "What's one improvement that would level up this curriculum?"

Maintaining an intentional Discussions space turns passive learners into an active alumni network. Celebrate wins, keep the cadence predictable, and continually point new learners to the community hub.
