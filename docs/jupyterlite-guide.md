# JupyterLite Interactive Lab

Welcome to the interactive coding environment for Coding for MBA!

## What is JupyterLite?

JupyterLite is a full-featured Jupyter environment that runs **entirely in your browser** using WebAssembly. 
No installation required, no server needed - everything runs on your computer!

## Features

‚úÖ **Full Python Support**: Run Python code with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more  
‚úÖ **No Setup**: Works immediately in any modern browser  
‚úÖ **Private**: All code runs locally - nothing is sent to a server  
‚úÖ **Persistent**: Your work is saved in your browser  
‚úÖ **Fast**: After initial load, everything is instant  

## Getting Started

1. **Click any "Launch in JupyterLite" button** on a lesson page
2. **Wait for the environment to load** (first time takes ~30 seconds)
3. **Start coding!** All lesson notebooks are pre-loaded

## Tips

!!! tip "First Launch"
    The first time you launch JupyterLite, it needs to download the Python runtime (~50MB).
    Be patient! Subsequent launches will be much faster.

!!! note "Browser Support"
    JupyterLite requires a modern browser:
    
    - ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge 90+
    - ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
    - ‚úÖ Safari 14+
    - ‚ùå Internet Explorer (not supported)

!!! warning "Limitations"
    Some features have limitations in the browser environment:
    
    - File system operations may not work
    - Some packages may not be available
    - Network requests may be restricted
    
    For full functionality, use the Binder option or run locally.
