# Phase 5 — Business Intelligence Specialization (Days 68–84)

Phase 5 extends the Coding for MBA journey into a 17-day Business Intelligence (BI) specialization. The schedule scaffolds each day around topics from the open-source [developer-roadmap BI Analyst track](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap), now mirrored in `data/bi_analyst_roadmap.json`. Use it to connect every lesson, cheat sheet, and notebook to the broader skills and concepts practiced by working BI teams.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of Days 68–84 you will be able to:

- Translate executive questions into BI roadmaps that align with core business functions.
- Design durable analytics data models, ETL workflows, and metric governance practices.
- Communicate BI insights through stakeholder-ready dashboards, storytelling, and experimentation.
- Plan career assets—including portfolios, certifications, and domain expertise—that showcase BI value.

!!! note "Using the roadmap data"
    The `BiTopic` utilities in `mypackage.bi_curriculum` load the developer-roadmap graph and let you group nodes by title. Use them to auto-build lesson outlines, cheat sheets, or dashboards that stay synchronized with Phase 5.

## How to integrate Phase 5 into delivery

1. **Lesson authoring** – Generate scaffolding for Day 68–84 READMEs by grouping roadmap topics with `group_topics_by_titles()` and folding them into narrative sections.
2. **Cheat sheets** – Pull curated topic groupings into [Phase 5 cheat sheets](cheatsheets/phase-5-business-intelligence.md) so learners have a single-page summary for refreshers and executive briefings.
3. **Notebooks & labs** – Map practice notebooks to roadmap nodes (e.g., *Time Series Analysis* or *Data Quality*) so hands-on exercises stay tethered to real BI competencies.
4. **Career planning** – Use Days 82–84 as template agendas for portfolio retrospectives, certification planning, and domain deep dives.

!!! tip "Attribution"
    The roadmap dataset is sourced from the MIT-licensed developer-roadmap project. Metadata in `data/bi_analyst_roadmap.json` records the origin and retrieval date so you can keep attribution current when updating the specialization.
