    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 10: Loops - Automating Repetitive Business Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you have a list of 10,000 sales transactions? You won't write code for each one. This is where **loops** come in. Loops allow you to perform the same action on every item in a collection, automating what would otherwise be an impossibly tedious task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Loop Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`for` loop:** The most common loop. It iterates over a sequence (like a list or dictionary) and executes a block of code for each item.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Calculate total revenue from a list of sales\n",
    "  total_revenue = 0\n",
    "  for sale in monthly_sales:\n",
    "      total_revenue += sale\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **`while` loop:** Runs as long as a certain condition is `True`. It's used when you don't know beforehand how many times you need to loop, such as in a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining Loops and Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "The real power comes from combining loops with `if` statements. This allows you to perform an action on only the items that meet a certain criteria, which is the foundation of filtering and transforming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find all transactions over a certain amount\n",
    "large_transactions = []\n",
    "for amount in transactions:\n",
    "    if amount > 500:\n",
    "        large_transactions.append(amount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `loops.py`, has been refactored to place each looping task into its own testable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_10_Loops/loops.py`. Notice the functions `calculate_total_from_list()`, `filter_high_value_customers()`, and `simulate_investment_growth()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_10_Loops/loops.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_10.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 10\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Average Employee Age:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_10.py`), create a list of employee dictionaries: `employees = [{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}, {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 45}, {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35}]`.\n",
    "   - Create a function `calculate_average_age(employee_list)` that takes a list of employee dictionaries.\n",
    "   - Inside the function, use a `for` loop to get the sum of all ages.\n",
    "   - Return the average age (`total_age / number_of_employees`).\n",
    "   - Call your function and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter High-Priority Customers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of customer dictionaries (see `loops.py` for an example).\n",
    "   - Import the `filter_high_value_customers` function from the lesson script.\n",
    "   - Call the function with your list of customers and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inventory Stock Alert:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a dictionary of product inventory: `inventory = {\"Laptops\": 15, \"Mice\": 150, \"Keyboards\": 45}`.\n",
    "   - Import the `check_inventory_levels` function.\n",
    "   - Call the function to get a list of low-stock items.\n",
    "   - Loop through the returned list and print an alert for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Incredible!** The combination of loops and conditionals is the foundation of almost all data processing and analysis tasks. You've completed the core structures of Python!"
