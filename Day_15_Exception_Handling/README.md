# ðŸ“˜ Day 15: Exception Handling - Building Robust Business Logic

In the real world, data is messy and operations can fail. A file might be missing, a user might enter text instead of a number, or you might try to divide by zero when calculating a financial ratio. Without a safety net, these errorsâ€”called **exceptions**â€”will crash your script.

**Exception handling** is the process of catching these errors and handling them gracefully so your program can continue running or fail in a predictable way.

## Key Concepts: `try` and `except`

The core of exception handling is the `try...except` block.

*   **`try` block:** You place the code that might cause an error inside the `try` block.
*   **`except` block:** If an error occurs in the `try` block, the code inside the `except` block is executed, and the program does not crash.

```python
# A common business scenario: calculating profit margin
try:
    # This might cause a ZeroDivisionError if revenue is 0
    margin = (profit / revenue) * 100
    print(f"Profit margin is {margin:.2f}%")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot calculate margin: revenue is zero.")
```

You can also catch specific error types like `ValueError` (e.g., trying to convert "abc" to a number) or `FileNotFoundError`.

## Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.

## Exploring the Refactored Code

The script for this lesson, `exception.py`, has been refactored to place the logic into testable functions that include exception handling.

1.  **Review the Code:** Open `Day_15_Exception_Handling/exception.py`.
    *   The `unpack_country_list()` function now includes a check to prevent errors with small lists.
    *   The new `calculate_profit_margin()` function demonstrates how to handle a `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` in a practical business calculation.
2.  **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions handle both successful cases and errors gracefully:
    ```bash
    python Day_15_Exception_Handling/exception.py
    ```
3.  **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify that the functions behave correctly, both with valid input and when exceptions are expected:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_day_15.py
    ```

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 15

1.  **Safe Division Function:**
    *   In a new script (`my_solutions_15.py`), create a function `safe_divide(numerator, denominator)`.
    *   Inside the function, use a `try...except` block to handle a potential `ZeroDivisionError`.
    *   If division is successful, return the result.
    *   If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, print an error message and return `0`.
    *   Test your function by calling it with valid numbers (e.g., `10, 2`) and with a zero denominator (e.g., `10, 0`).

2.  **User Input with Validation:**
    *   Create a function `get_user_age()` that prompts the user to enter their age.
    *   Use a `try...except` block to handle the `ValueError` that occurs if the user enters text instead of a number.
    *   If the input is invalid, print an error message and return `None`.
    *   If the input is valid, convert it to an integer and return it.

3.  **File Reading with Error Handling:**
    *   Create a function `read_file_contents(filepath)`.
    *   Use a `try...except` block to handle a `FileNotFoundError`.
    *   If the file is found, the function should read its contents and return them.
    *   If the file is not found, it should print an error message and return `None`.
    *   Test your function with a real file path and a fake one.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've learned how to make your Python scripts more robust and reliable. Exception handling is a critical skill for any data analyst or developer working with real-world data.
