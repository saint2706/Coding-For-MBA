    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 15: Exception Handling - Building Robust Business Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, data is messy and operations can fail. A file might be missing, a user might enter text instead of a number, or you might try to divide by zero when calculating a financial ratio. Without a safety net, these errorsâ€”called **exceptions**â€”will crash your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception handling** is the process of catching these errors and handling them gracefully so your program can continue running or fail in a predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts: `try` and `except`\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of exception handling is the `try...except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`try` block:** You place the code that might cause an error inside the `try` block.\n",
    "- **`except` block:** If an error occurs in the `try` block, the code inside the `except` block is executed, and the program does not crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A common business scenario: calculating profit margin\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # This might cause a ZeroDivisionError if revenue is 0\n",
    "    margin = (profit / revenue) * 100\n",
    "    print(f\"Profit margin is {margin:.2f}%\")\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot calculate margin: revenue is zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also catch specific error types like `ValueError` (e.g., trying to convert \"abc\" to a number) or `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `exception.py`, has been refactored to place the logic into testable functions that include exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_15_Exception_Handling/exception.py`.\n",
    "   - The `unpack_country_list()` function now includes a check to prevent errors with small lists.\n",
    "   - The new `calculate_profit_margin()` function demonstrates how to handle a `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` in a practical business calculation.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions handle both successful cases and errors gracefully:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_15_Exception_Handling/exception.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify that the functions behave correctly, both with valid input and when exceptions are expected:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_15.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 15\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe Division Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_15.py`), create a function `safe_divide(numerator, denominator)`.\n",
    "   - Inside the function, use a `try...except` block to handle a potential `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "   - If division is successful, return the result.\n",
    "   - If a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs, print an error message and return `0`.\n",
    "   - Test your function by calling it with valid numbers (e.g., `10, 2`) and with a zero denominator (e.g., `10, 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input with Validation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `get_user_age()` that prompts the user to enter their age.\n",
    "   - Use a `try...except` block to handle the `ValueError` that occurs if the user enters text instead of a number.\n",
    "   - If the input is invalid, print an error message and return `None`.\n",
    "   - If the input is valid, convert it to an integer and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Reading with Error Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `read_file_contents(filepath)`.\n",
    "   - Use a `try...except` block to handle a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "   - If the file is found, the function should read its contents and return them.\n",
    "   - If the file is not found, it should print an error message and return `None`.\n",
    "   - Test your function with a real file path and a fake one.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've learned how to make your Python scripts more robust and reliable. Exception handling is a critical skill for any data analyst or developer working with real-world data."
