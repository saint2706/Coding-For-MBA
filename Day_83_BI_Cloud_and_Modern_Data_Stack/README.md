# Day 83 – BI Cloud and Modern Data Stack

> This lesson is part of the Phase 5 Business Intelligence specialization. Use the [Phase 5 overview](../docs/bi-curriculum.md)
to see how the developer-roadmap topics align across Days 68–84.

## Why it matters

Modern BI teams assemble cloud-native tooling that balances time-to-value, governance, and spend. Understanding how the cloud
ecosystem fits together ensures analysts can navigate trade-offs when choosing warehouses, integration layers, and visualization
services.

## Developer-roadmap alignment

- Cloud Computing Basics
- Cloud BI Ecosystem
- Cloud data warehouses
- Providers: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Cloud

## Cloud architecture patterns

| Pattern | Components | Feature focus | Cost trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Centralized warehouse with semantic layer | Serverless warehouse, ELT pipelines, BI semantic model | Curated metrics exposed through governed BI layers | Reserved capacity discounts exchange flexibility for governance licensing costs |
| Lakehouse with streaming ingestion | Object storage, streaming ingestion, open table formats, SQL endpoints | Unified analytics supporting dashboards and ML on the same platform | Streaming autoscale fees must be balanced against freshness SLAs |
| Composable stack with reverse ETL | Cloud warehouse, transformation service, reverse ETL activations | Operationalizes analytics inside SaaS tools without duplicating logic | Connector-based pricing introduces variable spend per downstream system |

## Provider evaluation checklist

- Confirm the managed warehouse option (Redshift, BigQuery, Synapse) and how it scales.
- Map analytics services (QuickSight, Looker, Power BI) to stakeholder use cases.
- Align orchestration choices (Step Functions, Cloud Composer, Data Factory) with existing engineering standards.
- Capture pricing guardrails, including autosuspend, flat-rate commitments, and hybrid benefits.
- Note governance integrations such as IAM, Dataplex, and Purview for security reviews.

## Next steps

- Use the comparison matrix in `lesson.py` to facilitate vendor shortlists.
- Draft cost scenarios that highlight egress, autoscaling, and reserved capacity for each provider.
