# ðŸ“˜ Day 33: Accessing Web APIs with `requests`

## Overview
This lesson introduces a lightweight wrapper around the
[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) demo API. The module
exports three helpersâ€”`fetch_users`, `fetch_post`, and `fetch_posts_by_user`â€”that
return structured data for analytics workflows while keeping the HTTP layer easy
to mock during tests.

## Learning goals
- Understand how to issue HTTP GET requests with `requests`.
- Convert JSON payloads into `pandas.DataFrame` objects for analysis.
- Inject custom HTTP clients (for example, `requests.Session` objects or call
  stubs) to make networked code testable.

## Requirements
Install the core and testing dependencies into your environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest responses
```

`responses` is only needed when you want to simulate the API locally or run the
pytest suite.

## Running the lesson
### Live API demo
Execute the script directly to fetch data from JSONPlaceholder:

```bash
python Day_33_API/api.py
```

The command prints a preview of the user list, details for post `1`, and a table
of posts authored by user `2`.

### Mocked endpoints
The helper functions accept a `requests.Session` or any callable with the same
signature as `requests.get`. This allows you to supply canned responses when the
internet is unavailable or you want deterministic examples:

```python
from Day_33_API.api import fetch_users

class MockClient:
    def get(self, url, **kwargs):
        class _Response:
            def __init__(self, payload):
                self._payload = payload

            def raise_for_status(self):
                return None

            def json(self):
                return self._payload

        return _Response([{"id": 1, "name": "Ada", "username": "ada"}])

mocked_users = fetch_users(client=MockClient())
print(mocked_users)
```

The included pytest suite (see below) relies on the `responses` library to
provide richer, request-aware mocks if you prefer a declarative API.

## Tests
Run the Day 33 unit tests, which exercise both success and error paths using
mocked HTTP responses:

```bash
pytest tests/test_day_33.py
```

To execute the entire collection of lesson tests, run `pytest` from the project
root.
