    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 33: Accessing Web APIs with `requests`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces a lightweight wrapper around the\n",
    "[JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) demo API. The module\n",
    "exports three helpersâ€”`fetch_users`, `fetch_post`, and `fetch_posts_by_user`â€”that\n",
    "return structured data for analytics workflows while keeping the HTTP layer easy\n",
    "to mock during tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to issue HTTP GET requests with `requests`.\n",
    "- Convert JSON payloads into `pandas.DataFrame` objects for analysis.\n",
    "- Inject custom HTTP clients (for example, `requests.Session` objects or call\n",
    "  stubs) to make networked code testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the core and testing dependencies into your environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "pip install pytest responses\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`responses` is only needed when you want to simulate the API locally or run the\n",
    "pytest suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "### Live API demo\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the script directly to fetch data from JSONPlaceholder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python Day_33_API/api.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command prints a preview of the user list, details for post `1`, and a table\n",
    "of posts authored by user `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mocked endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The helper functions accept a `requests.Session` or any callable with the same\n",
    "signature as `requests.get`. This allows you to supply canned responses when the\n",
    "internet is unavailable or you want deterministic examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from Day_33_API.api import fetch_users\n",
    "\n",
    "class MockClient:\n",
    "    def get(self, url, **kwargs):\n",
    "        class _Response:\n",
    "            def __init__(self, payload):\n",
    "                self._payload = payload\n",
    "\n",
    "            def raise_for_status(self):\n",
    "                return None\n",
    "\n",
    "            def json(self):\n",
    "                return self._payload\n",
    "\n",
    "        return _Response([{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Ada\", \"username\": \"ada\"}])\n",
    "\n",
    "mocked_users = fetch_users(client=MockClient())\n",
    "print(mocked_users)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The included pytest suite (see below) relies on the `responses` library to\n",
    "provide richer, request-aware mocks if you prefer a declarative API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the Day 33 unit tests, which exercise both success and error paths using\n",
    "mocked HTTP responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest tests/test_day_33.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the entire collection of lesson tests, run `pytest` from the project\n",
    "root."
