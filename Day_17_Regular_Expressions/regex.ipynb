    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 17: Regular Expressions for Text Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the text data you need to analyze isn't perfectly structured. You might need to find all the invoice numbers in a document, extract all email addresses from a messy text block, or validate that a product code follows a specific format. For these tasks, we use **regular expressions** (regex).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Regular Expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It's like a mini-language for finding and manipulating text. While it can look intimidating at first, a few key patterns can solve most common business problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\\d+`: Matches one or more digits (e.g., `123`).\n",
    "- `[a-z]+`: Matches one or more lowercase letters.\n",
    "- `\\s`: Matches a whitespace character.\n",
    "- `\\b`: Matches a word boundary.\n",
    "- `[]`: Defines a character set (e.g., `[abc]` matches 'a', 'b', or 'c').\n",
    "- `[^...]`: Matches anything *not* in the character set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `regex.py`, has been refactored to place each regex task into its own testable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py`. Examine functions like `find_most_common_words()`, `extract_and_analyze_numbers()`, `is_valid_python_variable()`, and `clean_text_advanced()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_17_Regular_Expressions/regex.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each regex function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_17.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 17\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract All Numbers from a String:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_17.py`), you have a string: `text = \"Order #123 was placed for $49.99. The order contains 3 items.\"`\n",
    "   - Import the `extract_and_analyze_numbers` function from the lesson script. Note that it only extracts integers. Can you modify the regex inside it to extract floating-point numbers as well?\n",
    "   - Call the function and print the extracted numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate a Product Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A valid product code must follow the format `PROD-XXXX`, where `X` is a digit.\n",
    "   - Create a function `is_valid_product_code(code)` that returns `True` if the code is valid and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "   - Use the `re.fullmatch(pattern, string)` function. Your pattern should look something like `r'PROD-\\d{4}'`. (`\\d{4}` means exactly four digits).\n",
    "   - Test your function with `\"PROD-1234\"` (valid) and `\"PROD-123\"` (invalid).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clean Up a Messy Sentence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a sentence with extra symbols: `sentence = \"Contact us... at (support@example.com)!\"`\n",
    "   - Import and use the `clean_text_advanced` function from the lesson to remove the punctuation and symbols.\n",
    "   - Print the cleaned sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** Regular expressions are a fundamental tool for any data analyst who works with text. They provide a powerful and efficient way to clean, validate, and extract information from unstructured data."
