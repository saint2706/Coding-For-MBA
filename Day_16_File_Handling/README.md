## üöÄ Key Functions in `fh.py`

Our file handling module includes powerful functions for business analytics:

### Document Analysis

```python
def counter(fname: str) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Count words and lines in a text file."""
    
def find_most_common_words(fname: str, value: int) -> List[Tuple[int, str]]:
    """Find the most frequently used words in a text file."""
```

### Data Processing

```python
def most_spoken_languages(fname: str, value: int) -> List[Tuple[int, str]]:
    """Analyze language frequency from country data."""
    
def most_populated_countries(fname: str, value: int) -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, int]]]:
    """Find the most populated countries from JSON data."""
```

### Email Management

```python
def extract_emails(fname: str) -> List[str]:
    """Extract all email addresses from a text file."""
    
def check_email(word: str) -> bool:
    """Validate if a word is a valid email address."""
```

### Text Analytics

```python
def document_similarity(filename_1: str, filename_2: str) -> Optional[float]:
    """Calculate similarity between two text documents."""
    
def clean_text(text: str) -> str:
    """Clean and normalize text for analysis."""
```

## üíº Why File Handling is Critical for Business Analytics

In modern business, data comes from everywhere - reports, emails, surveys, social media, and databases. File handling skills enable you to:

- **Automate Data Processing**: Process thousands of documents without manual intervention
- **Integrate Systems**: Connect different business systems through file-based data exchange
- **Generate Reports**: Create persistent analysis reports for stakeholders
- **Monitor Trends**: Track business metrics and market trends from various data sources
- **Ensure Quality**: Validate and clean data from multiple sources
- **Scale Operations**: Handle growing volumes of business data efficiently

## üíª Exercises: Day 16

### Exercise 1: Document Statistics Analyzer

Create a function that analyzes multiple business documents and produces a summary report:

```python
def analyze_business_documents(file_paths):
    """
    Analyze multiple documents and return comprehensive statistics
    """
    total_words = 0
    total_lines = 0
    all_themes = {}
    
    for file_path in file_paths:
        words, lines = counter(file_path)
        total_words += words
        total_lines += lines
        
        # Extract top themes from each document
        themes = find_most_common_words(file_path, 5)
        for freq, word in themes:
            all_themes[word] = all_themes.get(word, 0) + freq
    
    return {
        'total_words': total_words,
        'total_lines': total_lines,
        'common_themes': sorted(all_themes.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]
    }
```

**Business Application**: Executive report summarization and content analysis.

### Exercise 2: Customer Contact Management System

Build a comprehensive email processing system:

```python
def process_customer_communications(input_files):
    """
    Extract and organize customer contact information
    """
    all_emails = []
    contact_database = {}
    
    for file_path in input_files:
        emails = extract_emails(file_path)
        for email in emails:
            if check_email(email):
                domain = email.split('@')[1]
                if domain not in contact_database:
                    contact_database[domain] = []
                contact_database[domain].append(email)
                all_emails.append(email)
    
    return {
        'total_contacts': len(all_emails),
        'companies': len(contact_database),
        'contact_by_company': contact_database
    }
```

**Business Application**: CRM data management and customer outreach campaigns.

### Exercise 3: Competitive Intelligence Tool

Develop a document comparison system for market analysis:

```python
def competitive_analysis(company_docs, competitor_docs):
    """
    Compare company content with competitor content
    """
    results = {}
    
    for comp_doc in company_docs:
        results[comp_doc] = {}
        for competitor_doc in competitor_docs:
            similarity = document_similarity(comp_doc, competitor_doc)
            results[comp_doc][competitor_doc] = similarity
    
    return results
```

**Business Application**: Content strategy and competitive positioning.

### Exercise 4: Market Research Data Processor

Create an advanced technology trend analysis system:

```python
def comprehensive_tech_analysis(data_files, technologies_to_track):
    """
    Track multiple technologies across various datasets
    """
    results = {}
    
    for tech in technologies_to_track:
        results[tech] = {'total_mentions': 0, 'files_mentioned': []}
    
    for file_path in data_files:
        tech_counts = analyze_technology_mentions(file_path)
        for tech, count in tech_counts.items():
            if tech in results:
                results[tech]['total_mentions'] += count
                if count > 0:
                    results[tech]['files_mentioned'].append(file_path)
    
    return results
```

**Business Application**: Technology investment decisions and market trend analysis.

## üìö Key Takeaways

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Always handle file operations with try-except blocks
2. **Encoding Matters**: Use UTF-8 encoding for international business data
3. **Context Managers**: Use `with` statements for automatic resource management
4. **Path Handling**: Use `os.path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Data Validation**: Always validate extracted data before processing
6. **Business Context**: Consider how file processing serves business objectives

## üí° Advanced Tips for Business Applications

### 1. Batch Processing Pattern

```python
def process_business_files(directory_path, file_pattern="*.txt"):
    """Process multiple files in a directory"""
    import glob
    
    files = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory_path, file_pattern))
    results = []
    
    for file_path in files:
        try:
            result = process_single_file(file_path)
            results.append({
                'file': file_path,
                'status': 'success',
                'data': result
            })
        except Exception as e:
            results.append({
                'file': file_path,
                'status': 'error',
                'error': str(e)
            })
    
    return results
```

### 2. Progress Tracking for Large Operations

```python
def process_with_progress(files, process_func):
    """Process files with progress indication"""
    total_files = len(files)
    results = []
    
    for i, file_path in enumerate(files, 1):
        print(f"Processing {i}/{total_files}: {os.path.basename(file_path)}")
        result = process_func(file_path)
        results.append(result)
        
        # Show progress percentage
        progress = (i / total_files) * 100
        print(f"Progress: {progress:.1f}%")
    
    return results
```

## üîó Integration with Other Business Tools

File handling often works with:

- **Databases**: Import/export data for analysis
- **APIs**: Process downloaded data files
- **Reporting Tools**: Generate input files for dashboards
- **Email Systems**: Process attachments and communications
- **Cloud Storage**: Handle files from cloud platforms

## üìñ Next Steps

After mastering file handling, explore:
