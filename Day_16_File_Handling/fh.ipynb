    "# üìò Day 16: File Handling for Business Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "A huge part of data analysis involves reading data from files and writing results to them. Whether you're processing a sales report, a customer list, or log files, you need to interact with the file system. Python makes this easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opening Files:** Use the `open()` function to open a file. It's best practice to use it with a `with` statement, which automatically closes the file for you, even if errors occur.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  with open('my_report.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "      content = file.read()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **File Modes:**\n",
    "  - `'r'`: Read (default). Throws an error if the file doesn't exist.\n",
    "  - `'w'`: Write. Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.\n",
    "  - `'a'`: Append. Adds content to the end of an existing file.\n",
    "- **Exception Handling:** When working with files, it's crucial to wrap your code in a `try...except FileNotFoundError` block to handle cases where a file might be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `fh.py`, has been refactored to provide several powerful, reusable functions for common business file-handling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_16_File_Handling/fh.py`. Examine functions like `count_words_and_lines()`, `find_most_common_words()`, `extract_emails_from_file()`, and `analyze_sales_csv()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script. It will create a few temporary demo files, run the analysis functions on them, print the results, and then clean up the files.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_16_File_Handling/fh.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** The tests for this lesson are more advanced. They create temporary files in memory to test the functions without needing actual files on your disk.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_16.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíª Exercises: Day 16\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze a Text File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_16.py`), create a simple text file named `my_memo.txt` and write a few sentences into it.\n",
    "   - Import the `count_words_and_lines` and `find_most_common_words` functions from the lesson script.\n",
    "   - Call these functions with your new file's path and print the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process a Simple CSV:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `create_sales_data(filepath, sales_data)` that takes a list of lists and writes it to a CSV file.\n",
    "   - Your `sales_data` could be `[['Product', 'Price', 'Quantity'], ['Widget A', '10.00', '50'], ['Widget B', '15.50', '30']]`.\n",
    "   - Import and use the `analyze_sales_csv` function from the lesson to read your new CSV and print the total revenue and average transaction value.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéâ **Excellent!** You can now programmatically read from and write to the most common file types. This is a fundamental skill for automating data intake, processing reports, and saving your analysis."
