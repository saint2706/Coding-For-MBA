# ðŸ“˜ Day 25: Capstone Case Study - Tying It All Together

Congratulations on making it to the capstone of our data analysis section! It's time to combine everything you've learnedâ€”from data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas to statistical analysis and visualizationâ€”to solve a realistic business problem from start to finish.

## The Business Problem

You are a business analyst at a mid-sized e-commerce company. The Head of Sales wants to understand the performance of different products and regions for the last quarter. They have provided you with a dataset of sales transactions and have asked you to answer the following key questions:

1. Which were the top 5 products by total revenue?
2. Which sales region generated the most revenue?
3. Is there a correlation between the price of a product and the number of units sold?
4. How did revenue trend over the quarter?
5. What are your key recommendations based on this analysis?

## Your Task: The Analysis Workflow

Your task is to perform a complete analysis by following the standard data analysis workflow. The `case_study_sales.csv` file is provided for this exercise.

### Step 1: Load and Inspect the Data

* Load the `case_study_sales.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Use `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.isnull().sum()` to get a first look at the data and identify any immediate issues (like missing values).

### Step 2: Clean the Data

* Handle any missing values. For this dataset, you can drop rows with missing data.
* Ensure all columns have the correct data type (e.g., 'Date' should be datetime, 'Price' should be a float).

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Answering Key Questions

* **Top Products:** Group the data by 'Product' and calculate the sum of 'Revenue' for each. Sort the results to find the top 5.
* **Top Region:** Group the data by 'Region' and calculate the sum of 'Revenue' for each.
* **Correlation:** Calculate the correlation between the 'Price' and 'Units Sold' columns.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Group the data by 'Date' and calculate the sum of 'Revenue' to see the daily trend.

### Step 4: Visualize Your Findings

* Create a **bar chart** showing the top 5 products by revenue.
* Create a **pie chart** or **bar chart** showing the revenue contribution of each region.
* Create a **line chart** showing the daily revenue trend over the quarter.

### Step 5: Write Your Summary

* Based on your analysis and visualizations, write a brief, non-technical summary of your findings.
* What are 1-2 actionable recommendations you would give to the Head of Sales? (e.g., "Focus marketing efforts on our top products," or "Investigate why the West region is underperforming.")

ðŸŽ‰ **Incredible Achievement!** Completing a case study like this means you have a solid, practical foundation in data analysis. You can now take a raw dataset, clean it, analyze it, visualize it, and extract actionable business insights. This is the core skill set of a data analyst.
