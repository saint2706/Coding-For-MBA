# ðŸ“˜ Day 36: Capstone Case Study - Tying It All Together

Congratulations on making it to Day 36 of the 50-day Python for Business Analytics journey! You've explored foundational Python, powerful data tools, and even built lightweight applications. Now it's time to combine everything you've learnedâ€”from data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas to statistical analysis and visualizationâ€”to solve a realistic business problem from start to finish.

## The Business Problem

You are a business analyst at a mid-sized e-commerce company. The Head of Sales wants to understand the performance of different products, regions, customer segments, and sales channels for the last several months. They have provided you with a dataset of sales transactions (now including `Customer Segment`, `Sales Channel`, and a pre-calculated `Revenue` column) and have asked you to answer the following key questions:

1. Which were the top 5 products by total revenue?
2. Which sales region generated the most revenue?
3. Which customer segments and sales channels are driving the most revenue?
4. Is there a correlation between the price of a product and the number of units sold?
5. How did revenue trend over the recent months?
6. What are your key recommendations based on this analysis?

## Your Task: The Analysis Workflow

Your task is to perform a complete analysis by following the standard data analysis workflow. The `case_study_sales.csv` file is provided for this exercise.

### Step 1: Load and Inspect the Data

* Load the `case_study_sales.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Use `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.isnull().sum()` to get a first look at the data and identify any immediate issues (like missing values or unexpected data types).

### Step 2: Clean the Data

* Handle any missing values. For this dataset, you can drop rows with missing data.
* Ensure all columns have the correct data type (e.g., 'Date' should be datetime, 'Price' should be a float, and `Revenue` should be numeric).

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Answering Key Questions

* **Top Products:** Group the data by 'Product' and calculate the sum of 'Revenue' for each. Sort the results to find the top 5.
* **Top Region:** Group the data by 'Region' and calculate the sum of 'Revenue' for each.
* **Customer Segments & Channels:** Group the data by `Customer Segment` and `Sales Channel` to understand which audiences and distribution paths drive revenue.
* **Correlation:** Calculate the correlation between the 'Price' and 'Units Sold' columns.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Resample or group the data by month using the `Date` column and calculate the sum of 'Revenue' to see the trend over time.

### Step 4: Visualize Your Findings

* Create a **bar chart** showing the top 5 products by revenue.
* Create a **pie chart** or **bar chart** showing the revenue contribution of each region.
* Create a **bar chart** highlighting revenue by customer segment or sales channel.
* Create a **line chart** showing the monthly revenue trend over the covered period.

### Step 5: Write Your Summary

* Based on your analysis and visualizations, write a brief, non-technical summary of your findings.
* What are 1-2 actionable recommendations you would give to the Head of Sales? (e.g., "Focus marketing efforts on our top products," or "Investigate why the West region is underperforming.")

A complete, end-to-end solution is provided in the `solutions.py` file for this lesson. Try to complete the case study on your own first!

ðŸŽ‰ **Incredible Achievement!** Completing a case study like this means you have a solid, practical foundation in data analysis. You can now take a raw dataset, clean it, analyze it, visualize it, and extract actionable business insights. This milestone sets you up perfectly for Day 37, where we'll reflect on the full 50-day program and map out your next steps.
