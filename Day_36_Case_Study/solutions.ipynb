    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 36 ties together the full analytics workflow. You will load the\n",
    "`case_study_sales.csv` dataset, clean it, surface core revenue insights, and\n",
    "present a concise set of recommendations. The helpers in this folder mirror the\n",
    "solution structure so that you can focus on translating business questions into\n",

    "| File | Description |\n",

    "## Suggested Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `load_case_study_data()` to import the CSV with parsed dates.\n",
    "1. Call `clean_case_study_data()` to enforce schema expectations and rebuild the\n",
    "   `Revenue` column when necessary.\n",
    "1. Explore metrics via `summarize_case_study()` or write your own aggregations\n",
    "   and visualizations.\n",
    "1. Capture narrative takeaways for the Head of Sales along with supporting\n",
    "   charts or tables.\n",

    "    4. There remains only a modest relationship between price and units sold, so pricing adjustments should be paired with targeted marketing.\n",

    "    Recommendations:\n",
    "    1. Double-down on laptop bundles and smartphone upsells for enterprise and consumer segments, respectively.\n",
    "    2. Invest in the marketplace channel internationally while reinforcing partner relationships in top-performing regions.\n",
