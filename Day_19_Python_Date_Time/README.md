# ðŸ“… Day 19: Python Date and Time

## Welcome to Day 19

Today, we'll learn how to work with dates and times in Python using the built-in `datetime` module. This is a fundamental skill for any analyst, as time-series data is ubiquitous in the business world.

## Why is Date and Time Manipulation Important for Business Analytics?

Working with dates and times is essential for:

- **Time-series analysis**: Analyzing trends and patterns over time (e.g., sales data, stock prices).
- **Calculating durations**: Measuring the time between events (e.g., the time it takes to process an order).
- **Filtering and grouping data**: Selecting data within a specific date range or grouping data by month, quarter, or year.

## The `datetime` Module

The `datetime` module provides classes for working with dates and times.

## Exploring `date_time.py`

The `date_time.py` script in this folder provides several examples of how to use the `datetime` module, including getting the current time, formatting and parsing dates, and calculating the difference between dates.

## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 19

1. **Format the current date**:
    - Write a Python script that gets the current date and time and prints it in the following format: "Today is 24 September, 2025".

2. **Calculate the number of days until your next birthday**:
    - Write a Python script that calculates the number of days from today until your next birthday.

3. **Parse a date string**:
    - You have a date string "2023-01-15". Write a Python script that parses this string into a `datetime` object.

### Solutions
