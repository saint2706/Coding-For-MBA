## Exercise 1: Install a package

"""
SOLUTION TO EXERCISE 1: Install a package

To install pandas (a powerful data analysis library), follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Run the following command:
   pip install pandas

3. To verify the installation was successful, run:
   pip show pandas

4. You can also check the version:
   pip show pandas | findstr Version     (Windows)
   pip show pandas | grep Version        (macOS/Linux)

Alternative commands:
- Install a specific version: pip install pandas==1.5.0
- Upgrade to latest version: pip install --upgrade pandas
- Install from requirements file: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Exercise 2: Explore a package

"""
SOLUTION TO EXERCISE 2: Explore the requests package

The requests library is one of the most popular Python packages for making HTTP requests.
It's commonly used in business applications for:
- API integrations
- Data collection from web services
- Microservice communication
- Web scraping (when appropriate)

Key information about requests.get():
- Documentation: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- The get() function sends a GET request to a specified URL
- Returns a Response object with status codes, headers, and content
- Supports parameters, headers, authentication, and more

Example usage:
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()  # Parse JSON response
        print(data)
