# JupyterLite Integration Summary

This document summarizes the JupyterLite integration completed for the Coding-For-MBA repository.

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Configuration Issues

**Problem**: The `jupyter_lite_config.json` file contained a `$schema` field that caused errors with the traitlets config loader.

**Solution**: Removed the `$schema` field from the configuration file.

**File Changed**: `jupyter_lite_config.json`

### 2. Installed Dependencies

Installed the following dependencies:
- `jupyterlite-core` (v0.6.4)
- `jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel` (v0.6.1)
- `jupyter-server` (v2.17.0)

These dependencies are documented in `docs/requirements.txt` and are installed in the GitHub Actions workflow.

### 3. Built JupyterLite Distribution

Ran `python tools/integrate_jupyterlite.py` which:
- Built the complete JupyterLite distribution in `site/jupyterlite/`
- Added JupyterLite launch buttons to all 67 lesson pages
- Created a new `docs/jupyterlite-guide.md` documentation page
- Generated API endpoints for all notebooks

**Generated Structure**:
```
site/jupyterlite/
â”œâ”€â”€ lab/                    # JupyterLab interface (main entry point)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Lab application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tree/              # File browser
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workspaces/        # Workspace management
â”œâ”€â”€ files/                  # All lesson content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day_01_Introduction/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Day_02_Variables_Builtin_Functions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Day_67_Model_Monitoring_and_Reliability/
â”œâ”€â”€ build/                  # JupyterLite runtime and assets
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # Content API endpoints
â””â”€â”€ index.html             # Landing page
```

**Size**: 135MB (includes Pyodide runtime, notebooks, and data files)

### 4. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

Modified `.github/workflows/docs.yml` to:
1. Install JupyterLite dependencies
2. Build JupyterLite before building MkDocs site
3. Upload the complete `site/` directory (including `site/jupyterlite/`)

**Key Workflow Steps**:
```yaml
- name: Install JupyterLite dependencies
  run: pip install jupyterlite-core jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel jupyter-server

- name: Build JupyterLite
  run: python tools/integrate_jupyterlite.py

- name: Build MkDocs site
  run: mkdocs build --strict
```

### 5. Updated Lesson Pages

All 67 lesson pages now include an "Interactive Notebooks" section with:
- Direct links to launch notebooks in JupyterLite
- Information about JupyterLite (browser-based, no installation required)
- Proper relative paths (`../../jupyterlite/lab?path=Day_XX/notebook.ipynb`)

**Example** (from `docs/lessons/day-01-introduction.md`):
```markdown
## Interactive Notebooks

Run this lesson's code interactively in your browser:

- [ðŸš€ Launch solutions in JupyterLite](../../jupyterlite/lab?path=Day_01_Introduction/solutions.ipynb){{ .md-button .md-button--primary }}
- [ðŸš€ Launch helloworld in JupyterLite](../../jupyterlite/lab?path=Day_01_Introduction/helloworld.ipynb){{ .md-button .md-button--primary }}

!!! tip "About JupyterLite"
    JupyterLite runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly. No installation or server required! Note: First launch may take a moment to load.
```

### 6. Updated .gitignore

Added `.jupyterlite.doit.db` to `.gitignore` to exclude the JupyterLite build cache file from version control.

## How to Verify

After the GitHub Actions workflow runs and deploys to GitHub Pages:

### 1. Check Main Site Navigation

1. Visit: `https://saint2706.github.io/Coding-For-MBA/`
2. Navigate to any lesson page (e.g., "Day 1: Introduction")
3. Scroll to the "Interactive Notebooks" section
4. Click "ðŸš€ Launch in JupyterLite" button

### 2. Verify JupyterLite Loads

1. After clicking the button, you should be redirected to `/jupyterlite/lab?path=...`
2. Wait for JupyterLite to load (first load may take 30-60 seconds)
3. The specified notebook should open in JupyterLab
4. Try running a cell to verify Python execution works

### 3. Direct URL Testing

You can also test direct access:
- JupyterLab interface: `https://saint2706.github.io/Coding-For-MBA/jupyterlite/lab/`
- Specific notebook: `https://saint2706.github.io/Coding-For-MBA/jupyterlite/lab?path=Day_01_Introduction/helloworld.ipynb`
- File browser: `https://saint2706.github.io/Coding-For-MBA/jupyterlite/lab/tree/`

### 4. Check Browser Console

If JupyterLite doesn't load:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Look for network errors (404s) that indicate missing files
4. Verify the path structure matches expectations

## Expected Behavior

### First Launch
- Takes 30-60 seconds to download Pyodide runtime (~50MB)
- Shows loading spinner in JupyterLab
- Browser may appear frozen briefly (normal)

### Subsequent Launches
- Much faster (< 5 seconds)
- Runtime cached in browser
- Instant notebook loading

### Known Limitations
- Some Python packages may not be available in Pyodide
- File system operations are limited
- Network requests may be restricted by browser security
- Requires modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)

## Troubleshooting

### JupyterLite Shows 404 Error
**Cause**: The `site/jupyterlite/` directory wasn't uploaded to GitHub Pages

**Solution**: Check that the GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully and uploaded the full `site/` directory

### Notebook Not Found
**Cause**: Notebook path doesn't match actual file location

**Solution**: Verify the notebook exists in `site/jupyterlite/files/Day_XX/notebook.ipynb`

### Python Runtime Won't Load
**Cause**: Browser doesn't support WebAssembly or blocked by extensions

**Solution**: 
- Try a different browser
- Disable ad blockers/privacy extensions
- Check browser console for specific errors

### Notebooks Load But Code Won't Run
**Cause**: Pyodide runtime failed to initialize

**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for Pyodide errors
- Verify CDN access isn't blocked

## Files Changed

1. `.github/workflows/docs.yml` - Added JupyterLite build steps
2. `.gitignore` - Excluded build cache file
3. `jupyter_lite_config.json` - Removed problematic `$schema` field
4. `docs/lessons/day-*.md` (67 files) - Added JupyterLite launch buttons
5. `docs/jupyterlite-guide.md` (new) - JupyterLite documentation
6. `site/jupyterlite/` (new, 135MB) - Complete JupyterLite distribution

- [Pyodide Documentation](https://pyodide.org/)
- [Repository Documentation Guide](docs/jupyterlite-guide.md)

## Maintenance

### Rebuilding JupyterLite

To rebuild JupyterLite locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install jupyterlite-core jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel jupyter-server

# Run integration script
python tools/integrate_jupyterlite.py

# Build docs (optional)
mkdocs build
```

### Adding New Lessons

New lessons are automatically included when:
1. A new `Day_XX_*/` directory is added with notebooks
2. The `jupyter_lite_config.json` is updated to include the directory
3. The integration script is run

The GitHub Actions workflow handles this automatically on push to main.

### Updating Pyodide

To update the Pyodide version:
1. Update `jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel` package version
2. Rebuild JupyterLite
3. Test thoroughly as package availability may change
