    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 6: Tuples - Storing Immutable Business Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While lists are great for data that changes, sometimes you need to store data that *shouldn't* change. For this, Python provides the **tuple**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is an ordered, **immutable** collection of items. \"Immutable\" means once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed. This makes tuples perfect for protecting the integrity of fixed data records.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A tuple for a transaction record (ID, Date, Amount)\n",
    "transaction = (1001, \"2024-03-15\", 499.99)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use a Tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Integrity:** Prevents accidental modification of data that should be constant.\n",
    "1. **Performance:** Tuples are slightly more memory-efficient and faster than lists.\n",
    "1. **Dictionary Keys:** Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unpacking Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common and elegant feature is \"unpacking,\" which lets you assign the items of a tuple to multiple variables at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "trans_id, date, amount = transaction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `tuples.py`, has been refactored to separate the logic for handling tuples into testable functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_06_Tuples/tuples.py`. Notice the functions `get_location_coordinates()` and `unpack_transaction()` that now contain the core logic.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_06_Tuples/tuples.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_06.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 6\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store Geographic Coordinates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_06.py`), a company's headquarters is located at latitude `40.7128` and longitude `-74.0060`.\n",
    "   - Store these in a tuple called `hq_location`.\n",
    "   - \"Unpack\" the tuple into `latitude` and `longitude` variables and print them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Product Dimensions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `format_dimensions(dims_tuple)` that takes a tuple of three numbers (length, width, height).\n",
    "   - The function should return a formatted string like `\"Dimensions (LxWxH): 25cm x 15cm x 10cm\"`.\n",
    "   - Call the function with a tuple like `(25, 15, 10)` and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List vs. Tuple - The Right Tool for the Job:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each scenario below, decide if a **list** or a **tuple** is more appropriate and write a comment in your script explaining why.\n",
    "     - Scenario A: Storing the monthly sales figures for the past year.\n",
    "     - Scenario B: Storing the RGB color code for your company's logo.\n",
    "     - Scenario C: Storing the names of employees in a department.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** You've learned about immutability and how to use tuples to ensure your data remains constant. Knowing when to use a tuple versus a list is a sign of a thoughtful analyst."
