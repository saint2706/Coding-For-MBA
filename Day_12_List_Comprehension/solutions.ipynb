    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 12: List Comprehension - Elegant Data Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, you constantly create new lists by transforming or filtering existing ones. While `for` loops work, Python provides a more concise, powerful, and often faster way to do this: a **list comprehension**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Syntax of List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension creates a new list in a single, readable line.\n",
    "\n",
    "`new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`[expression ... ]`**: The brackets that create the new list.\n",
    "1. **`expression`**: What to do with each item (e.g., `item * 1.1`, `item[\"name\"]`).\n",
    "1. **`for item in iterable`**: The loop part that iterates through the original list.\n",
    "1. **`if condition` (Optional):** A filter that decides whether to include the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The for loop way\n",
    "large_sales = []\n",
    "for sale in sales:\n",
    "    if sale > 1000:\n",
    "        large_sales.append(sale)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The list comprehension way\n",
    "large_sales = [sale for sale in sales if sale > 1000]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `list_comprehension.py`, has been refactored to place each list comprehension task into its own testable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_12_List_Comprehension/list_comprehension.py`. Notice the functions `apply_price_increase()`, `filter_large_sales()`, and `get_top_sales_performers()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_12_List_Comprehension/list_comprehension.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_12.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 12\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Sales Commissions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_12.py`), create a list of sales figures: `sales = [2500, 8000, 12000, 5500]`.\n",
    "   - Write a function `calculate_commissions(sales_list, commission_rate)` that takes a list of sales and a rate.\n",
    "   - Inside the function, use a list comprehension to return a new list of calculated commissions.\n",
    "   - Call your function with a 15% commission rate (`0.15`) and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter Products by Category:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of product dictionaries (see below).\n",
    "   - Create a function `filter_by_category(product_list, category)` that takes a list of products and a category name.\n",
    "   - The function should use a list comprehension to return a new list containing only the *names* of products in the specified category.\n",
    "   - Call your function with the category `\"electronics\"` and print the result.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     products = [\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Laptop\", \"category\": \"electronics\"},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"T-Shirt\", \"category\": \"apparel\"},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Keyboard\", \"category\": \"electronics\"}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Format Prices for Display:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of prices as floats: `prices = [49.99, 199.99, 19.95]`.\n",
    "   - Use a list comprehension to create a new list called `display_prices`.\n",
    "   - Each item in the new list should be a string, formatted as currency (e.g., `\"$49.99\"`).\n",
    "   - Print the `display_prices` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** List comprehensions are a powerful tool for writing clean, efficient, and professional Python code. They are heavily used in data analysis for quick and readable data transformations."
