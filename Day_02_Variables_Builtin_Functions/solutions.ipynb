    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 2: Storing and Analyzing Business Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Day 1, we performed basic calculations. Now, we'll learn how to store data in **variables** and use Python's **built-in functions** to analyze it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a labeled container for information. Instead of using a raw number like `500000`, we can store it in a variable called `revenue`, making our code more readable and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`revenue = 500000`**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Be Descriptive:** `quarterly_sales` is better than `qs`.\n",
    "- **Use Snake Case:** Separate words with underscores, like `cost_of_goods_sold`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Built-in Functions: Your Basic Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes pre-built functions for common tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `len()`: Finds the length (e.g., number of items in a list).\n",
    "- `sum()`: Calculates the sum of numbers in a list.\n",
    "- `min()` and `max()`: Find the minimum and maximum values.\n",
    "- `round()`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `variables.py`, has been refactored into functions to promote code reuse and testability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_02_Variables_Builtin_Functions/variables.py`. Notice how the logic is now organized into functions like `display_company_profile()` and `analyze_weekly_sales()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_02_Variables_Builtin_Functions/variables.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You will see the output from the example scenarios defined at the bottom of the script.\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can also run the tests for this lesson to see how we verify the functions' correctness:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_02.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Company Profile Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new Python script (`my_solutions_02.py`), declare variables for a fictional company: `company_name`, `year_founded`, `current_revenue`, and `is_publicly_traded`.\n",
    "   - Print each of these variables with a descriptive label.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A list of sales transactions is: `[150.50, 200.00, 75.25, 300.75, 120.00]`.\n",
    "   - Store these in a variable called `weekly_sales`.\n",
    "   - Use built-in functions to calculate and print:\n",
    "     - The total number of sales (`len()`).\n",
    "     - The total revenue (`sum()`).\n",
    "     - The smallest and largest sales (`min()`, `max()`).\n",
    "     - The average sale amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Profit Calculator Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a function `calculate_profit(revenue, expenses)` that takes two numbers and returns the difference.\n",
    "   - Call this function with some example numbers (e.g., `calculate_profit(50000, 35000)`) and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Well done!** You've learned how to store data in variables and use Python's built-in functions for analysisâ€”foundational skills for everything that comes next."
