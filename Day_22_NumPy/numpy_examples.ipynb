    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 22: NumPy - The Foundation of Numerical Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python lists are flexible, they aren't efficient for large-scale numerical calculations. For this, we use **NumPy** (Numerical Python), the fundamental package for scientific and numerical computing in Python. It is the bedrock upon which almost all data science libraries, including Pandas, are built.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why NumPy for Business?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core advantage of NumPy is **vectorization**. Instead of looping through 10,000 sales figures to apply a price increase, you can perform the operation on the entire dataset at once. This makes your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Faster:** NumPy operations are performed in highly optimized C code, making them orders of magnitude faster than Python loops.\n",
    "1. **More Readable:** `new_prices = prices * 1.05` is much clearer than a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key NumPy Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ndarray`:** The core data structure, a powerful N-dimensional array. It's like a Python list but faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations:** Performing math on entire arrays at once (e.g., `revenue = prices_array * units_array`).\n",
    "- **Array Methods:** NumPy arrays have built-in methods for fast calculations (e.g., `.sum()`, `.mean()`, `.max()`, `.std()`).\n",
    "- **Boolean Indexing:** Using a conditional to create a boolean array (`True`/`False` values) and then using that array to filter your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries (including `numpy`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `numpy_examples.py`, has been refactored to place each NumPy task into its own testable function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_22_NumPy/numpy_examples.py`. Examine the functions `calculate_revenue_vectorized()`, `analyze_sales_data()`, and `filter_above_average()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_22_NumPy/numpy_examples.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_22.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 22\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vectorized Revenue Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_22.py`), create two Python lists: `prices = [12.50, 15.00, 22.50]` and `units = [100, 85, 120]`.\n",
    "   - Import the `calculate_revenue_vectorized` function from the lesson script.\n",
    "   - Call the function with your lists and print the resulting NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Data Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have a list of sales figures: `sales_data = [250, 300, 280, 450, 500, 220, 180]`.\n",
    "   - Import and use the `analyze_sales_data` function to get a dictionary of statistics.\n",
    "   - Print the total sales and the mean sales from the returned dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conditional Filtering with Arrays:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import the `filter_above_average` function and the `numpy` library (`import numpy as np`).\n",
    "   - Create a NumPy array from your `sales_data` list from the previous exercise.\n",
    "   - Pass this array to the `filter_above_average` function to get a new array containing only the sales figures that were better than average.\n",
    "   - Print the resulting array.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Fantastic start!** NumPy is the essential first step into the world of high-performance data analysis in Python. Understanding vectorization will make all subsequent topics, especially Pandas, much easier to grasp."
