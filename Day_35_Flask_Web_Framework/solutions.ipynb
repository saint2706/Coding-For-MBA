    "\n",
    "Welcome to Day 35! This lesson contains a small Flask project that analyses submitted text and reports simple statistics such as word counts and lexical diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m venv .venv\n",
    "   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Install the dependencies for this lesson**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install -r Day_35_Flask_Web_Framework/requirements.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Flask application\n",
    "\n",
    "The application now exposes a `create_app()` factory in `Day_35_Flask_Web_Framework/app/__init__.py`, so it can be started with the Flask CLI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "FLASK_APP=Day_35_Flask_Web_Framework.app:create_app flask run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can execute the module directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m Day_35_Flask_Web_Framework.app\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once running, visit <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> to interact with the analyser. Use the **Post** page to submit text and review the calculated statistics on the **Result** page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated tests validate both the Flask routes and the helper functions that power the analyser. Execute them from the repository root:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pytest -k day_35\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíª Exercises: Day 35\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new route**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Add a new route to the `create_app` factory at the URL `/about`.\n",
    "   - Create a view function that returns a simple string, like \"This is the about page.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new template**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a new HTML file named `contact.html` in the `templates` directory.\n",
    "   - Add a new route to the Flask app at the URL `/contact` that renders the `contact.html` template.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pass data to a template**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Modify the `/about` route to pass your name to a new `about.html` template.\n",
    "   - In the `about.html` template, display the name that was passed from the view function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the solutions to these exercises in the `solutions.py` file in this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéâ **Congratulations!** You've learned the basics of Flask, a powerful tool for building web applications and dashboards with Python."
