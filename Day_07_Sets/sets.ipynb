    "# ðŸ“˜ Day 7: Sets - Managing Unique Business Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen lists for ordered data and tuples for immutable data. Now we'll learn about **sets**, which are powerful for two main business reasons: ensuring uniqueness and performing membership analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Set?\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is an **unordered** collection of **unique** items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unordered:** Items have no defined order.\n",
    "- **Unique:** A set cannot contain duplicate items.\n",
    "\n",
    "This de-duplication feature is one of the most common uses for sets in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set Operations: The Foundation of Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The true power of sets comes from their mathematical operations, which are invaluable for customer segmentation and cohort analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Python Operator | Business Question Answered |\n",
    "| :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Union** | `A | B` | What is the total unique audience for two groups? |\n",
    "| **Intersection** | `A & B` | Which customers are in *both* Group A *and* Group B? |\n",
    "| **Difference** | `A - B` | Which customers are in Group A *but not* in Group B? |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure you have followed the setup instructions in the main [README.md](../../README.md) to set up your virtual environment and install the required libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The script for this lesson, `sets.py`, has been refactored into functions to make the logic for de-duplication and segmentation reusable and testable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the Code:** Open `Day_07_Sets/sets.py`. Notice the functions `get_unique_items()`, `analyze_visitor_segments()`, and `upgrade_plan_features()`.\n",
    "1. **Run the Script:** From the root directory of the project (`Coding-For-MBA`), run the script to see the functions in action:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python Day_07_Sets/sets.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. **Run the Tests:** You can run the tests for this lesson to verify the correctness of each function:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pytest tests/test_day_07.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ’» Exercises: Day 7\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find Unique Customer Cities:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In a new script (`my_solutions_07.py`), you have a list of cities: `order_cities = [\"New York\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Chicago\", \"New York\", \"Boston\", \"Los Angeles\"]`.\n",
    "   - Import the `get_unique_items` function from the lesson script.\n",
    "   - Call the function with your list to get a set of unique cities and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze Website Visitor Activity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You have two sets of user IDs:\n",
    "     - `pricing_visitors = {\"user1\", \"user3\", \"user5\", \"user7\"}`\n",
    "     - `contact_visitors = {\"user2\", \"user3\", \"user4\", \"user5\"}`\n",
    "   - Import the `analyze_visitor_segments` function.\n",
    "   - Call the function with these two sets.\n",
    "   - Print the `intersection` and `difference_a_b` from the returned dictionary to find highly engaged users and users who only viewed pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Manage Product Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Your \"Standard Plan\" has a set of features: `standard_features = {\"reporting\", \"data_export\", \"basic_support\"}`.\n",
    "   - You want to add `[\"api_access\", \"priority_support\"]` for the \"Pro Plan\".\n",
    "   - Import and use the `upgrade_plan_features` function to create the new feature set for the Pro Plan.\n",
    "   - Print the resulting Pro Plan feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŽ‰ **Well done!** Sets are a specialized but incredibly efficient tool. When you need to de-duplicate a list or analyze the overlap between two groups, sets are the best tool for the job."
